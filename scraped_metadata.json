Everyone required to complete a COI report will receive an email directing them to do so.\nLog in to complete your COI report. (https://guide.rass.cornell.edu/conflicts-of-interest/)\nFor more information about COI policies, federal regulations, reporting requirements, and management of conflicts,\u00a0contactcoi@cornell.edu. (mailto:coi@cornell.edu)\nFor help, questions, or feedback about the RASS-COI system, contact the Research Administration Support Systems (RASS) team atrass@research.cornell.edu. (mailto:rass@research.cornell.edu)\nWhat is a Financial Conflict of Interest Related to Research?\nA Financial Conflict of Interest (FCOI) related to research exists when a financial interest \u2013 or other opportunity for personal financial gain \u2013 is likely to compromise or influence\u2014or appear to compromise or influence\u2014the objective design, conduct, reporting, or direct administration of research, the integrity of research, or the public\u2019s trust in research. FCOIs are a set of intersecting relationships, andalthough they are not inherently bad, they must be properly managed to protect the integrity of Cornell research.\nTheOffice of Research Integrity and Assurance (ORIA)administers FCOIs related to research. After a careful review of the COI reports, if necessary, ORIA puts Conflict Management Plans (CMPs) in place with the guidance of the FCOI Committee, perUniversity Policy 1.7, Financial Conflict of Interest Related to Research. For Conflicts of Interest and Commitment excluding FCOIs related to research, please seeUniversity Policy 4.14, Conflicts of Interest and Commitment (Excluding Financial Conflict of Interest Related to Research). (/offices/ORIA, https://policy.cornell.edu/policy-library/financial-conflict-interest-related-research, https://policy.cornell.edu/policy-library/conflicts-interest-and-commitment-excluding-financial-conflict-interest-related)\nLooking for Guidance?\nFor information about how to navigate COI issues between your financial interests and research activities, see the following pages.\n\nEntrepreneurship (/policies/fcoi-guidance-principles-underlying-conflict-interest-coi-and-conflict-commitment-coc)\n\nConsulting (/policies/fcoi-guidance-consulting-and-other-external-engagements)\n\nSBIR/STTR (/policies/fcoi-guidance-sbirsttr-projects)\n\nHuman Subject Involvement (/policies/fcoi-guidance-research-involving-human-participants)\nCOI Reporting\nIf you receive an email directing you to complete a COI report, it is because university policies dictate that you must do so, given your role and/or activities on behalf of Cornell. If you receive one of these emails, do not ignore it: these emails are sent only to people who must report.\u00a0Non-compliance with reporting requirements and failure to update your reported information in a timely manner can result in sanctions perUniversity Policy 1.7, Financial Conflict of Interest Related to Research.

These regulations are put in to place to ensure the safe and legal use of these materials in order to minimize the risk to the researcher, Cornell, and the greater community. Cornell manages the use of these materials in research through a variety of different mechanisms most of which involve review of the proposed research activity by a Cornell committee.\nRegulated Biological materials most often include the use ofrecombinant or synthetic nucleic acids (r/sNA)to generate transgenic or genetically modified organisms, the use of infectious agents (bacteria, fungi, virus, parasite, prion),biological toxins, and/orhuman derived materials(cell lines and tissues), in research activities.\nThe committees include the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), the Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research Oversight Committee (ESCRO), and the Dual Use Research of Concern (DURC) committee. Additional approvals from outside regulatory agencies may also be needed in order to conduct research, such as the Federal Select Agents (FSA) program, the USDA APHIS Biotechnology Regulatory Services (BRS) or Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), and various New York state agencies.\nInstitutional Biosafety Committee (IBC)\nThe Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) is a university committee mandated by Federal granting regulations to oversee the safe and responsible use of certain biological materials in research. The committee, in conjunction withEHS Biosafety, reviews applications known as Memorandum of Understanding and Agreement (MUA). TheIBC committeehas an electronic MUA submission system known asRASS-IBCand reviews MUA applications at their monthly meetings. Toget startedwith an IBC application, learn more aboutwhat needs IBC approval,find helpful guidance material, or if you have any questions you can reach out to theIBC office staffor reach out to thetrusted advisorfor assistance.

The coordination involves shared information and processes between the IBC, BSL-3/ABSL-3 Operations group, and the BSL-3/ABSL-3 Strategy and Planning group. The IBC is responsible for the review and approval of research involving RG3 agents in BSL3 conditions. The operations group oversees BSL3 facility training and operation, while the strategy and planning group coordinates the activities and allocation of space within BSL3 facilities. For further information about BSL3 research and training please see theBSL3 written programor contact the Cornell Biosafety Officer Joshua Tursejoshturse@cornell.edu. To inquire about space availability and cost for use of the facility please reach out to the College of Veterinary Medicine Associate Dean for Research and Graduate Education, Robert Weiss. (https://ehs.cornell.edu/system/files/private/resource-files/BSL3_Written_Program.pdf, mailto:joshturse@cornell.edu)\nResearch with Select Agents and Toxins\nResearch involvingSelect Agents and Toxinsmust be approved by the Federal Select Agent Program (FSAP) before the agent can be acquired and research conducted on it. For information about Cornell\u2019s Select Agent Program please visitEHS Biosafety Select Agents and Toxinsor contact the University Responsible Official for Select Agents Josh Tursejoshturse@cornell.edu.

In the event the research is classified as DURC, a risk assessment will be performed and communicated to the NIH or funding agency as applicable for approval. All DURC agents are also Select Agents or toxins so the DURC process may coincide with the FSAP process. After the DURC and FSAP processes have been completed, the IBC will then conduct their review as required by Federal regulation. Further information aboutDURC and the DURC process.

You can also always contact our staff atirbhp@cornell.edu, or schedule a Zoom consultation viaBookings. (/resources/about-irb-committee, mailto: irbhp@cornell.edu, https://outlook.office365.com/book/RASSIRBTraining@cornellprod.onmicrosoft.com/)\n*Weill Cornell Medicine has its ownIRBsand human research compliancestaff. (https://hrp.weill.cornell.edu/irb, https://hrp.weill.cornell.edu/about-us/contact-us)\nDo I need IRB approval?\nNot all research activities that involve humans--or data collected from humans--actually meet the definition of \"human subjects research\" under federal regulations. The Cornell IRB office has created adecision treeyou can use to help figure out if your study will need IRB review and approval. When in doubt, contact theIRB office. (/sites/default/files/2019-05/IRB%20Decision%20Tree.pdf, /offices/IRB)\nNote: \"Exemption\" from IRB review is not the same thing as \"not human subjects research.\" Exempt research is human subjects research that is exempted from U.S. federal regulation 45 CRF 46, based on specific research procedures, participant populations, and privacy and confidentiality practices. At Cornell, research eligible for exemption can be reviewed administratively by IRB staff, rather than the IRB committee. A protocol submission viaRASS-IRBis still required for exempt research, as investigators cannot self-exempt. (https://rass.cornell.edu/irb)\nSubmit an IRB protocol application\nTo obtain IRB approval/exemptionfor a new study, create a new protocol inRASS-IRB. We recommend you use ourinformed consent form templates. (https://rass.cornell.edu/irb, /forms/irb-consent-form-templates)\nFor changes to your protocol, you must request an amendment inRASS-IRB. For full board protocols, you must also submit arequest for continuing approval (renewal)each year, regardless of whether or not any of your study procedures or personnel have changed. (https://rass.cornell.edu/irb, https://rass.cornell.edu/irb)\nYou can check on the status of your protocol inRASS-IRB. How-to documentation for RASS-IRB is available on theRASS Guide Site. (https://rass.cornell.edu/irb, https://guide.rass.cornell.edu/institutional-review-board-for-human-participant-research/)\nLooking for Guidance and Resources?\nThe IRB office has a variety of resources that can help you to understand the main processes and guidelines used by the Cornell IRB, as well as external policies, regulations, and best practices that might apply to your research with human participants. Start with ourLife Cycle of an IRB Protocol resourcefor general information about Cornell IRB procedures, and the visit theIRB Guidance and Resources pagefor more detailed guidance and requirements. (/resources/life-cycle-irb-protocol, /resources/irb-guidance-and-resources)\nGet Training\nAll research personnel listed on an IRB protocol are required to complete human participant research ethics (IRB) training. For NIH-funded clinical trials, research personnel must also complete Good Clinical Practice (GCP) training.Cornell uses the onlineCITI programto provide these trainings. (/training/citi-online-courses-cornell-researchers-coi-irb-rcr-export-control)\nTake training, or learn more aboutIRB training requirements and options. (/training/citi-online-courses-cornell-researchers-coi-irb-rcr-export-control, /resources/irb-training)\nIRB Staff Consultations:IRB staff are available to meet via Zoom or phone to provide assistance with protocol applications and answer IRB-related questions. We useMicrosoft Bookingsto schedule Zoom consultations. You can also reach out directly to IRB staff; visit theIRB Office pagefor contact information.

What to do if a project ends early at Cornell. Support for publishing data and results.\nKey Concepts\nFinancial closeout is a shared responsibility between Sponsored Financial Services and your department.Sponsored Financial services reviews and closes project accounts, and submits the final fiscal report to sponsors.\nProjects are not officially closed until all final deliverables are met. If you continue to see projects in your dashboards that you think should be closed, your research administrator or department administrator may be able to help you see if a final deliverable has not been submitted.\nCompliance protocols and MUAs (IACUC, IBC, IRB) should be closed when a study is complete or the PI is leaving Cornell.For details about closure procedures, contact theIACUC office(animal projects), theIBC office(labs using rs/NA or biohazardous materials), or reviewIRB Policy #8: Closure of a Research Protocol(human participant projects). (/offices/iacuc, /offices/ibc, /policies/irb-policy-8-closure-research-protocol)\nClosing a project early usually happens when thePI moves to a different institution.Sponsored Financial Serviceswill help to complete the required forms for\u00a0the sponsor. (/resources/change-pi-or-key-personnel-and-effort, /offices/sfs)\nDecommissioning and vacating a laboratory.Laboratories must be properly decommissioned prior to leaving the university to ensure that all hazardous materials have been disposed of and equipment and surfaces are free of contamination.Contact EHSas early as possible to begin the process. Also, contact the IBC to close out your MUA (mailto:askehs@cornell.edu)\nTools\nRASS: Enter the date deliverables are submitted to sponsors. (http://guide.rass.cornell.edu/)\nCornell Data Services:get assistance meeting Federal and publisher requirements for public access to research results. (https://data.research.cornell.edu/data-management/planning/funder/)\nOpen Science Foundation (OSF): a scholarly web tool that enhances transparency, fosters collaboration, and increases the visibility of research outputs at leading research institutions. Apartnership between Cornell Universityand theCenter for Open Sciencenow provides a central hub for Cornell research projects. (https://data.research.cornell.edu/content/now-available-osf-institutions-cornell, http://cos.io/)\nDeadlines / Scheduling\nTheproject end date drives the closeout deadlines. Sponsored Financial Services sends reminders about account responsibilities. You can see the project end\u00a0date in thePI Dashboard. (/resources/pi-dashboard)\n90 days before terminationsubmit a request for an extension.Note:Extensions are not always granted. (/resources/no-cost-extensions)\nCost transfers that must be recorded in the general ledgermust be completed no later than 30 days prior to the deadline,or, if no financial report is due,no later than 60 days after the expiration date of the award.\nIf you're leaving the university, there may be requirements for closing and decommissioning your lab.Contact EHSas early as possibleto start the process. (mailto:askehs@cornell.edu)\nSpecial Requirements for Clinical Trials (human participants): For all federally-funded clinical trials, the PImustpost an IRB-approved consent formused for enrollment purposestoClinicalTrials.gov. This must be doneafter the study is closed to recruitment, but no later than 60 days after the last study visit by any participant. For NIH-funded clinical trials, study results must also be posted to the same website. For more information, visitIRB Considerations for Clinical Trials. (https://clinicaltrials.gov/, /resources/irb-considerations-clinical-trials)\nBest Practices\nUnderstand the conditions of your sponsored award and abide by the following policies governing research data retention and retention of records.\nCornell Data Services: Learn about data management and sharing best practices, or request a consultation to get assistance with your specific research data needs.

These new forms complete the staged implementation of significant changes outlined in policy notices (NOT-OD-21-073 and NOT-OD-21-110)\u00a0 to required disclosures of foreign collaborations, appointments, and research support. Some of these changes were effective May 25th for proposal, Just-in-Time (JIT), and Research Project Progress Report (RPPR) submissions. The use of the updated forms, including the new NIH requirement for Other Support documents to be certified and electronically signed by the PD/PI/KP, will be required as of January 25, 2022. This session will focus on how the signature requirement will be implemented at Cornell, the expanded reporting requirements, and the new \u201cForms-G\u201d application forms (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-21-169.html).

Fantastical sounding ideas such as the quantum internet are becoming a reality. Chemistry offers a unique approach to create the next generation of materials for quantum information science. With chemistry we take the atomistic control over structure and function that has been successful in drug design and repurpose it to create systems targeted for specific quantum applications. Recent results from Northwestern will be highlighted along with future applications in computing, sensing, and communication.\nRegistration is required to attend this free webinar.

While venture capital is their most likely next source of funding regardless of the gender makeup of the founding team, the startups with a female founder are slightly less likely to rely on them for funding. Companies founded solely by women garnered 2.1% of the total capital invested in venture-backed startups in the US[2].\n\nFor the third WI2 webinar, we speak with two women founders and CEOs from Cornell University to find out about their experience as female founders/CEOs and to hear about the lessons learned during the formation and the growth of their venture.\n\nPanelists:\nRachel Dorin, Ph.D., President and CEO, and Co-Founder, Terapore (https://ctl.cornell.edu/meet-the-panelists-of-running-a-startup-perspective-of-two-women-founders-and-ceos-from-cornell/#DrRachelDorin)\nSiyu Huang, Ph.D., Co-Founder and CEO, Lionano (https://ctl.cornell.edu/meet-the-panelists-of-running-a-startup-perspective-of-two-women-founders-and-ceos-from-cornell/#DrSiyuHuang)\nModerator:\nAlice Li, Ph.D., Executive Director, Center for Technology Licensing, Cornell University (https://ctl.cornell.edu/meet-the-panelists-of-running-a-startup-perspective-of-two-women-founders-and-ceos-from-cornell/#AliceLi)\nRegistration link:\nhttps://cornell.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_l6Q791OkRg2DgJIUt1VV-w (https://cornell.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_l6Q791OkRg2DgJIUt1VV-w)\n\n[1] 2020 Women in US Technology Leadership.

The federal agency submission systems are operational.Continue to use Cornell\u2019s federally negotiated F&A rates or other previously established rates (e.g., on training grants) for all proposals, including for NIH projects.\nContinue to use Cornell\u2019s federally negotiated F&A rates or other previously established rates (e.g., on training grants) for all proposals, including for NIH projects.\nSponsor proposal review timelines may be extended while federal agencies navigate pauses in specific areas.\nProposal deadlines may change. Reconfirming deadlines is recommended.\nConfirm that the funding announcement has not been revised or postponed.\nConsider signing up for funding alerts from the sponsor.\nAwards\nAvoid spending before the award is finalized or spending beyond the obligated budget in anticipation of a promised amendment. We\u2019ve seen some awards that looked promising but ultimately were not approved.\nThe terms and conditions of your executed award remain enforceable as long as your award is active.\nContinuations and post-award action approvals by federal agencies may be delayed.\nReview your award to ensure you understand your funding availability and reimbursement terms.\nClosely monitor obligated budget balances to avoid deficits while awaiting future obligations. Anticipated future funding remains subject to availability of funds and should not be considered guaranteed.\nPrioritize the submission of any technical reports or deliverables, especially those that may \u00a0be past due.\nKeep an eye on communications from your funding sponsor.\nCornell Research & Innovation is actively monitoring the federal government transition, executive orders, and agency guidance. We are working closely with university leadership to ensure compliance with changes that may impact Cornell. Our teams are collaborating with our professional associations to understand and track the implications of these directives as well.\nFind My GCO (Grant & Contract Officer) (/gco)\nResearch Data Access Update for the Cornell Research Community (/resources/research-data-access-update-cornell-research-community)\nQuick Reference\nRates (/rates)\nForms (/forms)\nPolicies (/policies)\nContacts (/contacts)\nTraining (/training)\nEvents (/events)\nNews & Announcements (/news)\n\u00a9 2019 Cornell University\nWeb Accessibility Help (mailto:rais-help@cornell.edu?subject=researchservices.cornell.edu%20site)"

You can attend some or all of the sessions; it\u2019s up to you. The focus is on proposal writing, but many of the skills taught will apply to any form of writing.\nEach week will begin with a brief tutorial on some aspect of writing, followed by a practical editing demonstration or exercise. Carmel will walk you through her editing process, explaining the hows and whys of grammar, syntax, messaging, and tone, to improve your writing. You will have the opportunity to send in examples of your writing ahead of each workshop to be selected to receive feedback live. There will also be time for you to ask specific writing questions. So whether you want to polish your skills, write more persuasively, or enhance your grammar skills in written English, these workshops will have something to help every writer.\nResearch Development (ReD) Team (/research-development)\nFeatured\nCornell's Research Development (ReD) Team promotes and facilitates research and innovation across the Ithaca campus, AgriTech, Cornell Tech, and Weill Cornell Medicine. We provide a range of services to help researchers enhance their skills as effective communicators, as grant proposal writers, and...\nThe Research Development team has compiled lists of funding and engagement opportunities\u00a0for new faculty, including downloadable calendars featuring selections of recurring research grants (many of which are geared toward early career faculty).\nQuick Reference\nRates (/rates)\nForms (/forms)\nPolicies (/policies)\nContacts (/contacts)\nTraining (/training)\nEvents (/events)\nNews & Announcements (/news)\n\u00a9 2019 Cornell University\nWeb Accessibility Help (mailto:rais-help@cornell.edu?subject=researchservices.cornell.edu%20site)"

(If you're working with NIH, these items may be called a Just in Time request.) Examples include the following:\nUpdates to budget\nSalary support quotes\nQuestions about expense calculations\nCorrecting errors\nCompliance approvals (IRB, IACUC, etc.)\nThese requests should be handled by the office that submitted the proposal:OSP,CALS,CVM. (/offices/osp, /offices/cals-office-sponsored-research, /offices/cvm-cro)\nAward Review and Finalization by OSP\nCornell's Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP) reviews and finalizes all sponsored awards on behalf of Cornell.\u00a0Some awards are accepted by Cornell without negotiation. Others require further review of terms and conditions, and may require negotiation. OSP\u202fwill always handle this stage of the process.\u202fThis stage can vary in length. You can see notes and updates in theResearch Administration Support System (RASS). (http://guide.rass.cornell.edu/)\nOSP should be notified by the sponsor when an award has been made. If a sponsor sends you notification of an award and does not include OSP as a recipient, please notify OSP by sending an email tocu_awards@cornell.edu. (mailto:cu_awards@cornell.edu)\nOSP will assign aGrant and Contract Officer (GCO)to work on the award. The GCO will review the requirements and will let you know if you need to complete requirements such as an IACUC protocol or NIH-specific COI requirements. (/gco)\nOnce the award has been finalized, the award information will be updated in RASS and you will receive an email fromcu_awards@research.mail.cornell.edunotifying you that the award has been finalized and your project has been awarded by the sponsor.\nA sponsored award should be publicly announced only AFTER the grant or award agreement has been finalized by OSP and is in effect. Receiving a \u201cnotice of award\u201d from the sponsor is not the same as a finalized grant or award agreement. SeeAnnouncing Externally Sponsored Awards: Guidance for Researchers. (/policies/announcing-externally-sponsored-awards-guidance-researchers)\nNote about Terms and Conditions:\u00a0The PI is responsible for understanding all of the terms and conditions for the award. A copy of the complete award document will be included as an attachment with the notification from OSP that the award has been finalized. The Additional Project Information PDF, attached with the same notification, will call attention to certain non-standard terms and conditions. (See Highlighted Terms and Conditions in the Additional Project Information PDF.) Non-standard terms and conditions may include, for example,\u00a0no-cost extensions, carryover, restrictions on the public announcement of the award, and publications review by sponsor.\nUpon distribution of the award, if no pre-award account has been established, your unit or Business Service Center will initiate a Contract Control Account in the Kuali Financial System. Once the Account is inFinal Status, it will be available in the general ledger for financial activity.\nRCR Requirements for Research Awards (/resources/rcr-requirements-research-awards)\nPI Eligibility (/policies/pi-eligibility)\nManage a Project (/manage)\nAnnouncing Externally Sponsored Awards: Guidance for Communicators (/policies/announcing-externally-sponsored-awards-guidance-communicators)\nAnnouncing Externally Sponsored Awards: Guidance for Researchers (/policies/announcing-externally-sponsored-awards-guidance-researchers)\nTransfer an Award from Another Institution (/resources/transfer-award-another-institution)\nQuick Reference\nRates (/rates)\nForms (/forms)\nPolicies (/policies)\nContacts (/contacts)\nTraining (/training)\nEvents (/events)\nNews & Announcements (/news)\n\u00a9 2019 Cornell University\nWeb Accessibility Help (mailto:rais-help@cornell.edu?subject=researchservices.cornell.edu%20site)"

You will receive a notice from the training program (or compliance office) to alert you to an expiring training.\nManaging Work with Hazardous Materials\nManaging safety in the laboratory is an integral and ongoing part of a successful research project. Proper management of hazards\u00a0reduces the potential for incidents that may negatively impact you, your staff, or your research, such as an\u00a0injury or illness, damage or destruction of research materials or data, a short term or long term loss of part or all of a facility, and/or a regulatory violation or fine.\nThe proper management of hazardous materials and equipment involves:\nUnderstanding and meeting regulatory and institutional requirements for working with hazardous materials and equipment.\nTraining to provide researchers with the knowledge and skills needed to safely perform their work.\nRisk assessments for new hazardous materials, processes, or equipment.\nControls to minimize risks. Examples of controls include fume hoods, biological safety cabinets, interlock systems, signage, and personal protective equipment.\nProper disposal of hazardous waste.\nHazardous Materials Guidance\nGuidance for managing work with hazardous materials can be found on theResearch Safety webpageor you canrequest assistance via askEHS.

Accounts are created by the Business Service Center. (/offices/osp)\nIf you need to\u00a0start spending before the award is finalized,\u00a0you'll need to confirm that pre-award spending is\u00a0allowed under the terms of the agreementandthat you have approval\u00a0from your department. The timing can vary.Pre-award spending may incur some risk.Your GCOcan help with the terms and conditions, butapproval must\u00a0come from your department. (/gco)\nReporting\nAnnual salary certification (effort)\u00a0reporting occurs once a year in June. You'll receive information from your department. (/resources/salary-certification)\nResearchers must update theirConflict of Interest (COI) reportsannually, and any time there are significant changes to their external financial relationships. In addition,PHS-funded researchersmust submit special COI reports for each new PHS award, as well as work-related travel. (/resources/coi-reporting-when-and-what, /resources/coi-requirements-nih-phs-funded-researchers)\nAnnual technical reports may be required by your sponsor. (Required by NSF and NIH, among others). This requirement is\u00a0in the terms and conditions for your award. If you have questions,ask your GCO. (/gco)\nAs the end date for your project approaches, see theClose a Project section.

(https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/common-rule/index.html)\nSummary of Common Rule Changes Affecting Cornell Research\nOur detailedguidance documentis the most complete source of information about how the changes will affect Cornell research with human subjects. (/policies/irb-policy-guidance-revised-common-rule)\nExemption categories.More research qualifies for exemption under the New Common Rule, including: secondary use of identifiable, sensitive data; research using \"benign behavioral interventions\" (e.g., playing a game, solving a puzzle).\nNo renewal requirement for most studies.The annual renewal requirement is eliminated for the vast majority of expedited studies (and for full board research, when remaining activities are limited to data analysis).\nChanges to informed consent.New elements are added to the basic information to be communicated during consent and, for federally-funded clinical trials, consent materials must be posted toClinicalTrials.gov. (https://clinicaltrials.gov/)\nExpansion of clinical trials.The concept of a \"clinical trial\" is expanded to include some basic biomedical and behavioral health-related research. A newguidance documentdetails compliance obligations specific to clinical trials, and provides basic information on how to register and provide updates onClinicalTrials.gov. (/policies/irb-guidance-clinical-trials, https://clinicaltrials.gov/)\nSingle IRB (\"sIRB\") requirement: Multi-institution studies must use a sIRB for review starting in January 2020.For NIH studies, a version of the sIRB requirement has been in effect since January 2018. (https://grants.nih.gov/policy/humansubjects/single-irb-policy-multi-site-research.htm)\nCommon Rule Changes to Informed Consent\nThe Common Rule includes new requirements for the informed consent process. In most cases no changes will be needed for consent documents that have already been approved by the IRB. For new studies, researchers should use the updatedconsent templates. (/forms/irb-consent-form-templates)\nNew Required Elements of Informed Consent\nThe IRB'sconsent templateshave been revised to reflect these new requirements: (/forms/irb-consent-form-templates)\n*Sequencing of a human germline or somatic specimen with intent to generate the genome or exome sequence of that specimen.\nA \"Concise Statement\"\nIn addition to the new required information, consent documents approved under the New Rule must begin with a concise and focused presentation of \"key information\" to assist prospective subjects in understanding why they might or might not want to participate. (46.116(a)(5)(i)). The IRB's newconsent templatesare designed to help researchers draft language that satisfies this requirement. (/forms/irb-consent-form-templates)\nRequired Public Posting on Certain Consent Forms\nBeginning on January 21, 2019, for all studies that are federally-funded and fit the definition of a \"clinical trial\", a consent form must be posted online \"after the clinical trial is closed to recruitment, and no later than 60 days after the last study visit by any subject...\" For multi-site studies, the consent form from only 1 site is required to be posted. The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) has identified two federal websites that will satisfy the posting requirement. The Cornell IRB strongly recommends that researchers fulfill this requirement by posting toClinicalTrials.gov. (https://clinicaltrials.gov/)\nHow do these Changes to the Consent Process Affect Studies Approved Before the New Common Rule Took Effect?\nIn most cases no changes will be needed. Given their simplicity and brevity, the typical 1-3 page consent forms and scripts used in social and behavioral research and based on Cornell IRB-approved templates, will satisfy the new requirement. On a case-by-case basis, the IRB may determine that changes are needed. If so, IRB staff will identify affected studies and work with the PI to revise the consent. Participants in ongoing studies will not need to be re-consented as a result of these changes.\nQuick Reference\nRates (/rates)\nForms (/forms)\nPolicies (/policies)\nContacts (/contacts)\nTraining (/training)\nEvents (/events)\nNews & Announcements (/news)\n\u00a9 2019 Cornell University\nWeb Accessibility Help (mailto:rais-help@cornell.edu?subject=researchservices.cornell.edu%20site)"

Departments will be brought into the new system on a rolling schedule beginning in December. (https://guide.rass.cornell.edu/)\nMany researchers at Cornell have already been using RASS for sponsored projects and IRB protocols. The new COI reporting will look and feel similar.\nRASS-COI includes enhancements to reduce processing delays for sponsored awards and IRB protocols and to improve the reporting process for everyone involved.\nGo to:What to Do|Schedule|For New Awards|Project Specific Disclosures (#todo, #schedule, #new, #specific)\nUpdated: 11/18/22\nWhat do I need to do?\nBeginning in December, the new RASS-COI system will be rolled out to departments gradually. You will receive an email task notification from RASS-COI when you are required to complete a COI report.\nThese notifications will be sent incrementally, by department, rather than to the entire university at the same time.You are not required to report until you receive the task notification from RASS-COI.From the date of that notification, you will have 45 days to complete your COI report before sanctions for non-compliance may apply to you.\nWe will be communicating with department leadership so they can share information about when your department will start using the new system. Referto the project schedule belowfor dates. (#schedule)\nNote: If you need assistance, the COI staff will have training available.\nPlanned Schedule\nResearch & Innovation Division\nCornell Tech\nCollege of Agriculture and Life Sciences\nUniversity Library\nArchitecture, Art, and Planning\nBowers CIS\nLaw School\nCollege of Arts & Sciences\nEngineering\nCollege of Human Ecology\nCollege of Veterinary Medicine\nBrooks School of Public Policy\nSC Johnson College of Business\nILR School\n\nFor new sponsored awards or IRB protocols\nIf you are named on a new sponsored award or IRB protocol, you must complete your COI report before that award or IRB protocol can be processed.Note: This means that you could be asked to report before the date listed in the schedule above for your department to begin using the new system.\nIf you receive a task notification from RASS-COI to complete a COI report, please complete it as soon as possible; waiting will cause delays in releasing your sponsored award or processing your IRB protocol.\nNote: If you need assistance, the COI Office will have training available.\nReport only once per year\nIn the past, Cornell used an annual COI reporting cycle. Everyone completed a COI report at the same time. Even if you had updated your COI report that year, you were still required to report again during the annual cycle.\nCornell is now using a \u201crolling cycle.\u201d This means that you only need to update your COI report once each year. If you update your COI report at any time throughout the year, the due date for your next report will be reset, and you won\u2019t be required to report again for another year. For example: you complete a COI report in January and then update it in March, your next update is not required until the following March.\nProject specific disclosures reduce delays in processing research funds and IRB approvals\nIf you havebothsignificant financial interests (such as equity or compensation over $5K) andeithersponsored awards or IRB protocols, you will now provideproject-specific answersfor a few questions to help Cornell understand whether there is a relationship that could present a COI issue. These disclosures will reduce delays in distributing your research funds and processing your IRB protocols. (#specific)\nSystem communications provide clarity\nYou\u2019ll receive notifications from the RASS-COI system when you have tasks to complete. These will be similar to the notifications you\u2019re already receiving about sponsored projects or IRB protocols and may include:\nCOI reporting deadlines\nNotification of project-specific disclosures to complete\nMissed deadlines (which may result in sanctions)\nCOI staff questions or comments that require your response\nA note about COI reporting requirements and the regulatory landscape:The regulatory landscape in which Cornell operates its research enterprise has significantly evolved and expanded in scope over the last few years. The COI staff and others in the administrative teams of the OVPRI are diligent in responding to this changing environment to protect the integrity of Cornell\u2019s institutional reputation. The newly redesigned RASS-COI report will help to ensure adequate disclosures of \u201cother\u201d support, and management of possible COIs and export-controlled information.\nCOI Project-specific disclosures: What are they, why do I need to complete them, and when?\nWhat is a project-specific disclosure?\nProject-specific disclosures are updates to your COI report in the form of a few short questions used to indicate relationships between your research and your financial interests. They only need to be completed if you have both significant financial interests (such as equity or compensation over $5K) and either sponsored awards or IRB protocols.\nWhen do I need to complete a project-specific disclosure?\nThe first time you complete a COI report in RASS-COI: If you are required to complete project-specific disclosures, you will receive an email fromcoi@research.cornell.eduasking you to do soimmediately after you submit your first COI reportin RASS-COI. At that time, you will need to log back into RASS-COI and complete a project-specific disclosure linking each of your significant financial interests with each or your sponsored awards and IRB protocols. For example, if you have two financial interests, two sponsored awards, and one IRB protocol, you will need to complete six project-specific disclosures. (mailto:coi@cornell.edu)\nWhen you are named on a new IRB protocol or a sponsored award: At that time, you will receive an email fromcoi@research.cornell.edu, asking you to complete a project-specific disclosure. If you do not have a current COI report on file at that time, you will need to complete one in addition to your project-specific disclosure. Until you do so, your IRB protocol or your sponsored award will be on hold, and the monies associated with your sponsored award will not be disbursed. (mailto:coi@cornelll.edu)\nWhen you report a new significant financial interest: Reporting certain types of financial interests, such as equity or compensation above $5K, will trigger the need for a project-specific disclosure. When you report such financial interests, you will receive an email fromcoi@research.cornell.eduasking you to complete a project-specific disclosure linking that financial interest with each of your sponsored awards and IRB protocols. (mailto:coi@cornell.edu)\nThis new process seems burdensome to me. Why do I need to do it?\nWe understand that the project-specific disclosure process may seem burdensome, especially for researchers with multiple significant financial interests, sponsored awards, or IRB protocols. However, project-specific disclosures are critical to identifying conflicts of interest related to your research so that we can help you manage them. This in turn improves the processes in place that protect researchers and the integrity of research at Cornell. Completion of project-specific disclosures will also lead to far fewer delays in processing your sponsored awards and IRB protocols, and will reduce interruptions to your research activities due to compliance screening processes.\nWe\u2019re here help. Please reach out to us atcoi@cornell.eduif you need assistance completing your project-specific disclosures. (mailto:cornell.edu)\nI submitted my COI report and then immediately got an email telling me to complete a project-specific disclosure. Why?\nWhether or not project-specific disclosures are required of you depends on what types of financial interests you report. Until you submit your COI report, the RASS-COI system has no way to determine whether you\u2019ve reported anything that requires the completion of a project-specific disclosure. When you submit a report in which you\u2019ve disclosed things such as equity interests or compensation above $5K, you will receive an email fromcoi@research.cornell.eduasking you to complete a project-specific disclosure if you are also named on sponsored awards or IRB protocols. (mailto:coi@cornell.edu)\nOne research administration support system for Sponsored Research, IRB, and COI\nWhen RASS-COI is live, Cornell will be using one system for Sponsored Projects, IRB, and COI. One shared system increases transparency, reduces the time required to distribute your research funds and process your IRB protocols, improves compliance with federal regulations, and allows for research administration at Cornell to function more efficiently and effectively, while continuing to adjust to changing regulations and expectations from our partners.\nQuick Reference\nRates (/rates)\nForms (/forms)\nPolicies (/policies)\nContacts (/contacts)\nTraining (/training)\nEvents (/events)\nNews & Announcements (/news)\n\u00a9 2019 Cornell University\nWeb Accessibility Help (mailto:rais-help@cornell.edu?subject=researchservices.cornell.edu%20site)"

Increased scrutiny of China\u2019s activities in the U.S. has been the main focus of this concern.\nIt is important that this increased scrutiny over foreign activities in federally sponsored research does not result in a chilling effect on Cornell\u2019s existing and future international collaborations and research. We do not condone threats to academic freedom or discrimination against any person based on ethnicity or national origin.Please see the full letter text on the Global Cornell site.

New NIH Data Sharing and Management Policy\n2. RASS-COI \u2013System for Conflicts of Interest Reporting\n3. One Year In: RASS-IRB Quirks and Reminders\n4. Cornell University Buying Manual Update \u2013 Paying Human Participants\n5. Freedom of Information Request Procedures\n6. Welcome, VPRI Dr. Krystyn Van Vliet\n1. New NIH Data Sharing and Management Policy\nIn January 2023, a new NIH policy for Data Management and Sharing went into effect for NIH-funded research, and we at the Cornell University IRB are here to guide you through the implications for human participant research and your IRB protocols. We are putting together a guidance document regarding the impact of the policy on our process and procedures, and will post that on our website as soon as it is ready.\nFor now, when you are submitting protocols to the IRB for review that involve (or potentially involve) NIH funding, you should plan to include your Data Sharing and Management Plan in the protocol. In your RASS-IRB application, you can upload this in the Additional Documents section, under Other Documents.\nWe have also producedthis news item, which includes resources for you to read to learn more about this policy change and how it might impact you and your research. (/news/nih-policy-change-new-data-management-and-sharing-policy)\n2. RASS-COI \u2013System for Conflicts of Interest Reporting\nOur colleagues at the Conflicts of Interest Office launched a new reporting system in December 2022, RASS-COI, which is integrated with RASS-IRB and RASS-OSP. This primarily impacts Cornell faculty and staff who are named on IRB proposals through the institution of \u2018project-specific disclosures,\u2019 which you can read more about on theRASS-COI Launch Plan. If you have any questions or concerns regarding COI reporting, including the project-specific disclosure, you should reach out tocoi@cornell.edu. (/news/conflict-interest-system-launch-plan, mailto:coi@cornell.edu)\n3. One Year In: RASS-IRB Quirks and Reminders\nIt has been over a year since RASS-IRB launched in February 2022, and the system has improved our workflow and efficiency. We have learned a few quirks to the system that we would like to share with you so that you can avoid delays in the IRB review process:\nChat Functionality:The chat/conversation feature for Review Comments is helpful for communicating about details of your protocol, but IRB staff do not get an alert if you put something in the chat \u2013 if you need to communicate something to the IRB administrator quickly, email or call them. Otherwise, they will only know to look at the Review Comment chat once you resubmit the protocol.\nAttestations Pending: Once a protocol has been submitted, it goes to an \u2018attestations pending\u2019 status until the Principal Investigator (and the Faculty Advisor, if relevant) have completed their attestations. Until the attestations have been completed, the IRB Administrator who has been assigned to the protocol will not see it in their queue, and cannot begin the review process.\nProtocol Resubmission:When you are returning your protocol with edits, make sure to complete the final step of the process of hitting the \u2018Resubmit\u2019 button at the very bottom of the page, to return the protocol to your IRB Administrator\u2019s queue.\nRequirements Table: If you are unsure of where your protocol is in the review process, check the \u2018Requirements\u2019 table at the bottom of the page \u2013 this will tell you what requirements are still left unfinished.\nHuman Subjects Training:If someone on your research team has completed training and the \u2018Requirements\u2019 table still shows that task as incomplete, do not worry. Cornell training on CITI is integrated with RASS-IRB, and updated within 48 hours. That said, the two systems connect based on NetID, so make sure that the team member\u2019s CITI account has their Cornell NetID-based email address listed in their user profile.If you have already uploaded training documentation from non-Cornell training sources for that individual, the IRB Administrator will check over the documentation and mark the training requirement as complete during their review.\nProtocol Editing: If you are in the protocol and are unable to edit it, it is likely due to one of these reasons: either it has been re-submitted to the IRB, or someone else has it open. If it has been re-submitted, you can see that at the bottom of the \u2018Requirements\u2019 table. If someone else has it open, you can see their name at the top of the protocol, in a yellow banner. Only one person can view and edit a protocol at a time.\nRevision Comparison Tool:If you need to look at the ways that your protocol has changed between amendments, or between different iterations of the same review, you can use the Revision Comparison tool at the top of the \u2018Requirements\u2019 table.\nDocument Uploading: The RASS-IRB system is intended to help keep protocols organized to avoid delays caused by confusion. To assist with this, upload individual study materials (e.g., interview scripts, consent forms) in the correct sections of the protocol record, rather than a single document containing multiple study materials.\nSeeking Assistance: When in doubt: a) check to see if theRASS Guide Sitehas a how-to guide for a particular task you have to complete in RASS-IRB, b) set up aBookingsappointment for a 1:1 Zoom consultation with the relevant IRB or RASS staff member, or c) write torass@research.cornell.eduwith system problems orirbhp@cornell.eduwith human participant research or protocol questions. (https://guide.rass.cornell.edu/institutional-review-board-for-human-participant-research/, https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/RASSIRBTraining@cornellprod.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/, mailto:rass@research.cornell.edu, mailto:irbhp@cornell.edu)\n4. Cornell University Buying Manual Update \u2013 Paying Human Participants\nThe newSection 630of theCornell Buying Manualprovides guidelines to be followed when paying financial incentives to human research participants. If your protocol involves payments to human participants \u2013 whether through cash or gift card, if the research takes place in a lab or through online survey tools \u2013 you should familiarize yourself with these requirements and procedures. We have also added new text to ourinformed consent form templatesto communicate key information about payment logistics (e.g., taxable income, business center staff access to personal identifiers, etc.). (https://www.dfa.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/bm-section-630.pdf, https://www.dfa.cornell.edu/procurement/buyers/manual, /forms/irb-consent-form-templates)\n5. Freedom of Information Request Procedures\nOccasionally, researchers may receive requests for information that appear to be under the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) or the New York State Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). The University Relations office is responsible for responding to such requests and has set up an e-mail address for public records requests originating from outside of Cornell University:publicrecords@cornell.edu. You can read more about Cornell\u2019s FOIA/FOIL-related procedureson the University Relations website. If anyone contacts you with an apparent FOIA or FOIL request, please direct them to that website. (mailto:publicrecords@cornell.edu, https://universityrelations.cornell.edu/resources/public-records-requests/)\nRelatedly, if a federal agency has received a FOIA request that impacts Cornell records, you may be contacted by that agency for your feedback.\u00a0While University Relations is not responsible for responding to such requests, you may reach out toOffice of Sponsored Programs(if applicable), University Relations (viapublicrecords@cornell.edu), orOffice of General Counselfor consultation. (https://researchservices.cornell.edu/offices/osp, mailto:publicrecords@cornell.edu, https://counsel.cornell.edu/contact-us-2/)\n6. Welcome, VPRI Dr. Krystyn Van Vliet\nDr. Emmanuel Giannelis, the Walter R. Read Professor of Engineering in the College of Engineering, has stepped down as Cornell\u2019s Vice President for Research and Innovation (VPRI). He served in the position for five-and-a-half years beginning in 2017, and we thank him for his leadership.\nDr. Krystyn Van Vliet began her term as the new VPRI on February 1, 2023. The position includes the role of Cornell University\u2019s Institutional Signatory Official for the purposes of our Federalwide Assurance (FWA) with the Department of Health and Human Services, wherein we commit to comply with federal human subjects research regulation 45 CFR 46. Dr. Van Vliet previously served as the Associate Provost and Associate Vice President for Research at MIT. She joined the faculty of MIT in 2004, serving as a professor of Materials Science and Engineering and Biological Engineering, specializing in material chemomechanics. We look forward to working with her in the years to come. You can read more about Dr. Van Vliet inthis news item from the Cornell Chronicle.

The Cornell IRB Office wants to ensure researchers are aware of the amendment requirements for those \u201cmigrated\u201d protocols, as well as the reasons behind them. (https://rass.cornell.edu/irb)\nFor migrated protocols that received Expedited or Full Board Cornell IRB Review:\nRequirement: At the point of amendment or continuing review, all current protocol information must be in the protocol record in RASS-IRB. Unfortunately, our previous system did not allow us to migrate more than basic protocol meta-data and system-issued memos (i.e., protocol title, study personnel, review type, high level details of previous amendments, approval letters). This means thatfor Expedited and Full Board protocols,the PI or another research team member needs to enter into RASS-IRB all other IRB-approved protocol details and documents that are currently being used for the study, along with any changes being proposed.\nReason: For the IRB to use RASS-IRB to review protocol amendments and continuing reviews, the staff and committee members need to be able to have all the relevant information about that protocol easily accessible within the protocol record. RASS-IRB is built so that all details about a protocol are easy to find, and amendments are easy to track. In order for the system to work as designed, though, we need the protocol details for all studies requiring IRB review\u2014including those migrated from our old database\u2014to be viewable in this new system of record.\nAdditional Points:We know for some researchers it is burdensome or frustrating to have to re-enter details about an already-approved study\u2014especially studies that have been amended multiple times\u2014and we do apologize for the inconvenience.Unfortunately, the IRB staff do not have the ability to enter the full details of all active Expedited and Full Board protocols (~700) without researchers\u2019 assistance. In addition to capacity issues, we found during usability testing that PIs were better equipped to fill in the gaps in the protocol records, not only because of speed but also accuracy (given some of the questions are phrased differently than in the old forms, and a few questions are new). That being said, the IRB staff are very willing to help as best we can\u2014just ask.We believe that this one-time time investment from researchers will pay off in smoother and faster IRB review processes going forward; for all subsequent amendments and continuing reviews, researchers will only need to edit the protocol fields that are being changed, or upload new versions of modified study documents. The system will document the version changes, for easy comparison.\nWe know for some researchers it is burdensome or frustrating to have to re-enter details about an already-approved study\u2014especially studies that have been amended multiple times\u2014and we do apologize for the inconvenience.\nUnfortunately, the IRB staff do not have the ability to enter the full details of all active Expedited and Full Board protocols (~700) without researchers\u2019 assistance.

The system will document the version changes, for easy comparison.\nFor migrated protocols that were determined to be Exempt from IRB review:\nRequirement:For Exempt protocols migrated from the old system, amendment requests will continue to be accepted via email (irbhp@cornell.edu),for the time being. PIs are welcome to update the protocol record in RASS-IRB and process their Exempt amendments through that system, if they so desire, but it is not required. For exempt protocols submitted through RASS-IRB on or after February 1, 2022, though, please do use RASS-IRB to request amendments. (mailto:irbhp@cornell.edu)\nReason: Because Exempt protocols are not beholden to the same rigorous review requirements as Expedited and Full Board IRB protocols, the IRB staff have more flexibility with the review and documentation processes. The review of an amendment to an Exempt protocol primarily serves as a check to make sure the changes will not impact the protocol's eligibility for exemption, so a review of the amendment in the context of the full protocol is often not necessary.\nGuidance and Training:\nVisit theRASS Guide Siteto find recordings ofZoom trainings, as well as step-by-step, how-to documentation for various tasks within the new system, includingamending a protocol. These how-to guides can be found under the IRB tab of the top navigation bar.

(#footnote1_GnJeWEMHi4DsdP-vgUxWrjsfEdGtQu8E83tZOdbYFCA_lrHvOP5AH05E, /resources/irb-training)\nEither course titled \"IRB Training\" or \"IRB Basic\" will be accepted.\nThe Cornell IRB Training course consists of a set of modules that can be completed one at a time, and the entire training usually takes 2-4 hours to complete.\nThis training will need to be completed by October 1, 2022, and repeated every five (5) years.\nThis requirement applies to all study personnel involved in existing, active Exempt protocols as of October 1, 2022, as well as new protocols determined to be Exempt on or after that date.\nAs with Expedited and Full Board protocols, the IRB office will not issue an approval/exemption letter until training is complete for all study personnel.\nProtocol PIs will be responsible for ensuring their research team members stay in compliance with this training requirement.\nFor study personnel who are not affiliated with Cornell, equivalent training will be accepted.\nIf you are unsure if you have completed Cornell\u2019s CITI training for human participant research within the past five years, you can reviewthis list of Cornell IRB training recordspulled directly from CITI, or log into theCITI Program website(CornellSSO link) to check the details of your own course completion records. (https://irb.cornell.edu/lookup/index.cfm, https://about.citiprogram.org/, http://www.oria.cornell.edu/training/citi/login/index.cfm)\nIf you are unsure if your IRB protocol received Exempt review, you can search for your protocol(s) inRASS-IRB; check the field called \u201cReview Type\u201d for this information. For more help, see the RASS Guide Site How-To Guide forFinding an IRB Protocol. (https://rass.cornell.edu/irb, https://guide.rass.cornell.edu/institutional-review-board-for-human-participant-research/locate-an-irb-protocol/)\nWe will send additional reminders about this new training requirement prior to its implementation date, and also post updated information toour website. (/compliance/human-research)\nThank you in advance for your cooperation. As always, feel free to reach out to the IRB office viairbhp@cornell.eduif you have any questions or concerns. (mailto:irbhp@cornell.edu)\n1Research eligible for Exempt review is a subset of human participant research that presents no more than minimal risk to participants, and fits within one or more categories defined byfederal IRB regulations. Exempt research is covered by Cornell\u2019s Human Research Protection Program, and handled via IRB Administrator review.

Therules were updatedon October 17, 2023. While the new export controls are largely targeted at the People\u2019s Republic of China, including Macau and Hong Kong, (collectively \u201cPRC\u201d), the breadth and scope extend beyond the PRC. The controls are intended to restrict the PRC\u2019s ability to obtain advanced computing chips, develop and maintain supercomputers, and manufacture advanced semiconductors. (https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2022-21658/additional-export-controls-certain-advanced-computing-and-semiconductor-manufacturing-items, https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/about-bis/newsroom/2082)\nActions: PerPolicy 4.22, all international shipments must be approved by theExport Control Office. (https://policy.cornell.edu/policy-library/export-and-import-control-compliance, https://researchservices.cornell.edu/offices/export-controls-office)\nA few of the highlights of the new rule:\nAdds certain advanced and high-performance computing chips and computer commodities that contain such chips to the Commerce Control List (CCL) - meaning a license will likely be required.\nAdds new license requirements for items destined for a supercomputer or semiconductor development or production end use.\nExpands the scope of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) over certain foreign-produced advanced computing items and foreign produced items for supercomputer end uses.\nAdds certain semiconductor manufacturing equipment and related items to the CCL \u2013 meaning a license will likely be required.\nAdds new license requirements for items destined to to facilities that fabricate\u00a0integrated circuits.\nRestricts the ability of U.S. persons to support the development, or production, of integrated circuits at certain\u00a0facilities without a license.\nAdds new license requirements to export items to develop or produce semiconductor manufacturing equipment and related items.\n\nMany entities in the PRC (including universities) are being added on a rolling basis to restricted parties lists administered by Department of Commerce. As a result, heightened due diligence is necessary when dealing with parties in the PRC. Contact theECOfor a screening of foreign parties (particularly in the PRC) that you wish to collaborate or otherwise deal with.

Based on faculty feedback, the site is organized around the stages of the research lifecycle, which aligns with similar sites at other large research institutions.\nThe new site consolidates the content previously available on websites for the Center for Animal Resources and Education (CARE), the Office of Research Integrity and Assurance (ORIA), the Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP), and Sponsored Financial Services (SFS). (Those four sites are being retired.) The new site also includes relevant content from Cornell Technology Licensing (CTL) and Environment, Health and Safety (EHS), but those two sites will remain separate.\nBenefits of the Consolidated Website\nA single site address to remember.\nCentral communication, which reduces duplication.\nOrganized by research process stages to clarify information for faculty.\nSearch results that can be filtered by office.\nQuick access to most important web pages, systems, and tools related to research at Cornell.\nQuick Tips\nLists of all Rates, Policies, Contacts, Forms and more are handy at the bottom of each page.\nFilter search results by the associated Office or to show only a particular kind of content, for example, Rates or Forms.\nThe Essential Tools links to systems and tools\u00a0is always convenient at the top or bottom of every page.\nQuickly find any office helping to support or administer research at Cornell in the Research Offices list at the bottom of every page.\nQuestions?

The new policy intends to promote transparency and accountability in research by setting a minimum set of expectations for data management and sharing. (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-21-013.html)\nThe Cornell University IRB is in the process of putting together a guidance document regarding the impact of the policy on our process and procedures. For now, when you are submitting protocols to the IRB for review that involve (or potentially involve) NIH funding, you should plan to include your Data Sharing and Management Plan in the protocol. In your RASS-IRB application, you can upload this in the Additional Documents section, under Other Documents.\nBelow, we have provided resources to read more about this policy change, and learn how it impacts you and your research.\nResources\nThe NIH\u2019s central resource for this new policy is at theirNIH Scientific Data Sharing website. If you would like to read the full text of the policy, you can read theNIH\u2019s Final Policy notice. This notice includes definitions related to the policy as well as all information required to be compliant. Additionally, the NIH has provided multiple supplemental documents with guidance particularly relevant when crafting IRB protocols.Protecting Privacy When Sharing Human Research Participant Data\u2013 We specifically suggest reviewing the sections titled \u2018Operational Principles for Protecting Participant Privacy When Sharing Scientific Data\u2019 and \u2018Best Practices for Protecting Participant Privacy When Sharing Scientific Data.\u2019Responsible Management and Sharing American Indian/Alaska Native Participant Data\u2013 If you are focusing your research on these indigenous populations, we highly recommend reviewing this guidance document, especially the sections titled \u2018Considerations for Researchers Working with Tribal Nations\u2019 and \u2018Best Practices for Researchers.\u2019 (https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy, https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-21-013.html, https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-22-213.html, https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-22-214.html)\nProtecting Privacy When Sharing Human Research Participant Data\u2013 We specifically suggest reviewing the sections titled \u2018Operational Principles for Protecting Participant Privacy When Sharing Scientific Data\u2019 and \u2018Best Practices for Protecting Participant Privacy When Sharing Scientific Data.\u2019 (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-22-213.html)\nResponsible Management and Sharing American Indian/Alaska Native Participant Data\u2013 If you are focusing your research on these indigenous populations, we highly recommend reviewing this guidance document, especially the sections titled \u2018Considerations for Researchers Working with Tribal Nations\u2019 and \u2018Best Practices for Researchers.\u2019 (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-22-214.html)\nCornell University has also developed resources to assist with this policy change.Cornell Data Services (CDS) offers free and confidential feedback on draft plans, as well as guidance for creating and implementing plans. For a broader view of the NIH data policy, the RDMSG has a page offrequently asked questionson their website.

Final Reminder: New Exempt Protocol Training Requirement - Effective 10/1/22\nAs ofOctober 1, 2022, all research team members onall active IRB protocols\u2013newandpreviously approved\u2013are required to complete online human participant research training. Previously, this training was only required for researchers on Expedited and Full Board protocols, but the Cornell IRB has expanded this requirement to include personnel listed onExempt protocols, as well.\nThis training can be completed throughthe CITI Program. We have recently published aguidance documentto walk new CITI users through accessing the IRB Training (as well as any other CITI training you may be assigned by Cornell compliance groups). (https://researchservices.cornell.edu/training/citi-online-courses-cornell-researchers-coi-irb-rcr-export-control, /sites/default/files/2022-09/Guide%20to%20Accessing%20CITI%20Training%20for%20Cornell%20Researchers.pdf)\nResearchers need to take trainingevery five (5) years.\nThe IRB office will not issue an approval/exemption letter for any pending protocols/amendments/continuing reviews if personnel are missing training. This has always been the case for Expedited and Full Board protocols, but starting October 1, this practice will be implemented for Exempt protocols, as well.\nProtocol PIs will be responsible for ensuring their research team members stay in compliance with this training requirement.\nPlease see our originalIRB News announcementfrom July 29, 2022 for other detailsabout this training requirement, including how to see if you are up-to-date with your IRB training. (/news/irb-news-new-training-requirement-exempt-research)\n2. Revised Guidance for Conducting In-Person Research During the COVID-19 Pandemic\nAs of September 7, 2022, we have updated ourCOVID-19 guidanceandFAQs. The most significant changes are: (/policies/irb-policy-guidance-person-research-during-covid-19-pandemic, /resources/irb-covid-19-faqs)\nIn line with other campus health & safety requirements,face masks arerequiredfor in-person, on-campus human participant research activities similar to clinical exams or procedures, or that take place in campus healthcare settings.Forall other indoor human participant research activities, the IRBstrongly encouragesuse of face masksfor participants and research staff.\nWeno longer requireresearchers keep a daily log of study participants, as Cornell University and the local public health department are no longer conducting contact tracing.\nTheSample Study Participant COVID-19 Information Sheethas been revisedto reflect current safety measures. (This document is an appendix to theCOVID-19 IRB guidance.) (/sites/default/files/2020-07/Cornell%20IRB%20-%20Sample%20Study%20Participant%20COVID-19%20Information%20Sheet.docx, /policies/irb-policy-guidance-person-research-during-covid-19-pandemic)\nIf you are conducting in-person research on the Cornell Ithaca, Geneva, or Tech campuses, please review therevised guidance documentin full. As always, please contact theIRB officewith any questions. (/policies/irb-policy-guidance-person-research-during-covid-19-pandemic, /offices/IRB)\n3. New and Upcoming Resources\nWith the new Exempt protocol training requirement, there will be plenty of you who have never needed to take CITI training before having to access this resource for the first time. Never fear: we have published a guidance document on the IRB website to take you through the process of accessing any CITI training for the first time:Guide to Accessing CITI Training for Cornell Researchers. It will be located on the IRB Training page as of October 1st. (/sites/default/files/2022-09/Guide%20to%20Accessing%20CITI%20Training%20for%20Cornell%20Researchers.pdf)\nWe have another resource currently in development: alibrary of real examples of informed consent documentsthat we hope can assist you with this essential element of your protocols by illustrating how different types of research enact informed consent principles. We will share more news as the project moves along.\n4. RASS-IRB Tips\nThis is our first newsletter since our RASS-IRB system launched in February 2022\u2013 the new system has already made our jobs as staff members much easier, and we hope it has positively impacted you, as well. We wanted to take this opportunity to give a few tips about submitting protocols in the new system.\nTheRASS Guide siteis available with directions for various actions you might need to take in the RASS-IRB system. Specifically, we have over a dozen \u201chow-to\u201d guides, as well asmultiple webinars availableto introduce you to the new system and provide guidance for getting started with a new protocol. IRB and IT staff will continue to revise and add to these resources. If you need more individual assistance, you can easily make an appointment to meet on Zoom with RASS-IRB support or IRB staff usingMicrosoft Bookings. (https://guide.rass.cornell.edu/, https://cornell.app.box.com/v/rass-irb-training, https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/RASSIRBTraining@cornellprod.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/)\nIf you had your protocol approved before February 1, 2022, it is considered \u2018migrated\u2019 (from the old IRB system). Unfortunately, we were unable to bring all protocol data from the previous system to RASS-IRB, and as such, many migrated protocols do not currently contain much of the original protocol information. To process amendments to Expedited and Full Board protocols within RASS-IRB,we require that this information be entered into the system\u2013 we apologize for the inconvenience that this places upon researchers but hope you can understand the importance of having complete protocols in the new system.We can still process amendments to migrated Exempt protocols via e-mail.More information about this can be foundon our website here. (/news/irb-news-amendments-migrated-protocols)\nYour CITI Training records should be automatically imported into the RASS-IRB system, matching records based on your Cornell NetID. If you or one of your fellow investigators are in compliance with training but this does not show on your RASS-IRB protocol, log in to CITI and ensure that your primary e-mail is your Cornell NetID e-mail address. Directions for how to access that part of your CITI account arehere, on page 4. The integration between CITI and RASS can take 24-48 hours, but if your training still isn\u2019t registering after that, contactirbhp@cornell.edu. (/sites/default/files/2022-09/Guide%20to%20Accessing%20CITI%20Training%20for%20Cornell%20Researchers.pdf, mailto:irbhp@cornell.edu)\n5. New Staff, Valerie and Lydia\nPlease welcome our two new members of the IRB staff!\nValerie Ziarniak has been with ORIA for a little over a year and worked with the COI and IACUC teams in different temporary roles before being hired in June 2022 as the newest IRB Administrator. She conducts protocol pre-reviews, facilitates the IRB review process, and assists researchers in maintaining compliance with appropriate federal and state laws, ethical principles, and Cornell IRB guidelines. She lives in Rochester and works remotely most days but does travel to Ithaca from time to time.\nLydia Galarneau joined the IRB team in July 2022 as the new IRB Compliance Assistant. She manages the IRB inbox, processes new protocol submissions, and has been developing new guidance documents and tools for researchers like you. She moved from Buffalo to Ithaca in August, and lives on South Hill with her partner and their cats, Praxis and Milo.\nQuick Reference\nRates (/rates)\nForms (/forms)\nPolicies (/policies)\nContacts (/contacts)\nTraining (/training)\nEvents (/events)\nNews & Announcements (/news)\n\u00a9 2019 Cornell University\nWeb Accessibility Help (mailto:rais-help@cornell.edu?subject=researchservices.cornell.edu%20site)"

Applicants and recipients must maintain supporting documentation to reasonably authenticate that the appropriate individual signed the form and make such documentation available upon request to NIH. PDs/PIs/KP cannot delegate this signature.\nOSP recommends the use ofAdobe Sign.It is recommended that staff in NIH-funded departments obtain a license to Adobe Sign (individual licenses are free as part of Cornell\u2019s institution-wide license) as soon as possible and understand the process by which to circulate Other Support documents for signature. The December 2021 OSP Roundtable was devoted to this topic. The slides and recording can be found here:https://researchservices.cornell.edu/training/osp-roundtable. The slides include step-by-step instructions on using Adobe Sign and generating a flattened PDF, beginning on slide 17. (https://it.cornell.edu/e-sign, https://researchservices.cornell.edu/training/osp-roundtable)\nAdditional NIH requirements are related to the expanded definition of what constitutes Other Support.Please be diligent in providing the required information in Other Support:\nAllresources made available to researchers in support of and/or related to all of their research endeavors, regardless of whether or not they have monetary value and regardless of whether those resources are based at Cornell. This includes, but is not limited to:\nResources and/or financial support from all foreign and domestic entities that are available to the researcher, including financial support for laboratory personnel, and provision of high-value materials that are not freely available.\nConsulting activities that involve research and falloutsideof an individual\u2019s appointment, separate from institution\u2019s agreement.\nIn-kind contributions: office/laboratory space, equipment, supplies, or employees or students supported by an outside source.\nIn addition, the PD/PI/KP is required to submit copies of contracts specific to senior/key-personnel foreign appointments and/or employment with a foreign institution for all foreign activities and resources that are reported in Other Support . If they are not in English, recipients must provide translated copies (see NIHGPS 2.5.1). This does not include personal service contracts, or employment contracts for fellows supported by foreign entities. (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps/html5/section_2/2.5.1_just-in-time_procedures.htm)\nBiosketch\nThe format and instructions for the Biosketch have also changed:\nSection B \u201cPositions and Honors\u201d has been renamed \u201cPositions,Scientific Appointments, and Honors and requires a list inreversechronological order\u00a0ofall positions and scientific appointments both domestic and foreign, including affiliations with foreign entities or governments. This includes titled academic, professional, or institutional appointments whether or not remuneration is received, and whether full-time, part-time, or voluntary (including adjunct, visiting, or honorary).\nSection D has been removed for all non-fellowship biosketches.\nThe new formats and instructions must be used for all due dates on or after January 25, 2022.\nQuestions?OSP recognizes the additional burden placed on researchers and research administrators and welcomes questions and feedback on Cornell\u2019s implementation and communication of these requirements. Please contact Mary-Margaret Klempa, Senior Director, OSP (mk636@cornell.edu) orosp-help@cornell.eduwith your questions.

(https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&SID=83cd09e1c0f5c6937cd9d7513160fc3f&pitd=20180719&n=pt45.1.46&r=PART&ty=HTML, https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/single-irb-requirement/index.html, #CR_Agencies)\nWhat is an sIRB?\nAn sIRB is the IRB of record, selected on a study-by-study basis, which provides the ethical review and related administrative coordination for all sites participating in a multi-site study and assumes responsibility for all human participant research compliance.\nWho will this impact?\nFederally-funded studies, with very few exceptions, are required to use an sIRB for review and approval of cooperative studies conducted in the United States. This applies to all cooperative research applications and contract proposals submitted on or after January 20, 2020.\nIf you are conducting an NIH-funded study,a version of the sIRB requirementhas been in effect since January 25, 2018. For NIH-funded studies, all multi-site projects with non-exempt human participant research (clinical and non-clinical) where the same research protocol is conducted at more than one domestic site are required to use an sIRB. Applicants are required to include an sIRB Plan in their NIH proposal, identifying which IRB has agreed to serve in this role. Note: other federal funders may require a similar sIRB plan be submitted with proposals, going forward. (https://grants.nih.gov/policy/humansubjects/single-irb-policy-multi-site-research.htm)\nWhat happens next?\nThe Cornell IRB is currently not equipped to serve as the sIRB, but will comply with the requirements for a participating IRB when another institution serves as the IRB of record.

(https://guide.rass.cornell.edu/intro/)\nRASS-IRB now:\nReplaces the paper IRB protocol form and email-based review and approval process with an online protocol management system that provides visibility into the current status of your IRB protocol and review process.\nReplaces the email-based amendment process with version control to easily compare the current amended IRB protocol with the previous approved version.\nReminds you if your protocol requires a continuing review so that you can submit the renewal request prior to your protocol\u2019s expiration.\nKeeps track of your IRB protocol details so that you can easily print or view your IRB approval letters, access important protocol documents such as consent forms and recruitment documents, and view previous versions including changes requested as part of IRB review.\nAllows you to connect your protocol to your sponsored proposal or award that is already in RASS Sponsored Projects.\nReplaces the paper form for reporting to the IRB protocol deviations or unexpected events that have taken place during the research.\nWhat Should I Do Now?\nThe IRB office stopped accepting all emailed protocol submissions (including amendments for Expedited and Full Board protocols)at 5PM on Friday, January 21.New submissions should now be created in RASS-IRB.\nHigh level data about current, active protocols from the current IRB system has been transferred to the new system. (Data about closed or abandoned IRB protocols, or protocols determined not to be human subjects research, will not be transferred to RASS.)The first time you amend a protocol imported from the old IRB system, you will need to fill in portions of the protocol application in RASS-IRB. Please anticipate needing to spend at least an hour on that process. Most information requested in RASS-IRB can be copied from your previous protocol applications, but there are a few questions collecting new information. Learn more about this amendment requirement and the reasons behind ithere.If you have trouble filling out the form, you can review how-to documentation on theRASS Guide Site, watch a recording of a Zoom training, or request a 1:1consultation with RASS or IRB staff.We will be happy to help you! (/news/irb-news-amendments-migrated-protocols, http://guide.rass.cornell.edu, https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/RASSIRBTraining@cornellprod.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/)\nFor those of you conducting active data or biospecimen collection,RASS-IRB requires thatall informed consent/assent forms must be uploaded as PDFs. Please prepare your consent forms as PDFs the next time you create a new protocol or amend an existing protocol. The system will stamp IRB-approved consent/assent forms in thebottom right-hand corner, so pleaseleave space there (1\u201d from the bottom, 2\u201d from the right edge).\nIf you have approved protocols that need to be closed or pending protocols or amendments that are no longer needed, please emailirbhp@cornell.eduASAP. (mailto:irbhp@cornell.edu)\nWhat Happens When RASS-IRB Launches?\nWe've launched! You should now use RASS-IRB to:\nCreate and submit all new IRB protocols (including protocols for which you intend to rely on another IRB, and requests for an IRB determination for a funding agency before the protocol is fully developed).\nAmend IRB protocols.Note 1:As mentioned in the previous section, the first time you amend a protocol imported from the old IRB system you will need to fill in portions of the protocol in RASS-IRB, so anticipate needing to spend at least an hour on that process. Training and support will be made available (see information below). Learn more about this amendment requirement and the reasons behind ithere.Note 2:For existing Exempt protocols imported from the old system, amendment requests will continue to be accepted via email for now. However,new Exempt protocols created in RASS-IRB will need to be amended in that system. (FYI IRB SOP #2 on Exemption Requests is in the process of being revised, in part to better clarify the types of modifications that require an amendment to an Exempt protocol. Watch for that updated SOP in the coming months.)

We have successfully implemented the Sponsored Projects portion of the project and will upgrade the IRB and IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee) systems in early 2022. The next phases will bring upgrades to the systems used for IBC (Institutional Biosafety Committee) and COI (Conflicts of Interest).\nThe project timeline is maintained here:https://guide.rass.cornell.edu/timeline/. (https://guide.rass.cornell.edu/timeline/)\nThe RASS project has already simplified and improved many procedures involved in sponsored projects. When the project is complete, Cornell will have a set of modern, integrated, and simplified tools supporting our research enterprise.\nQuick Reference\nRates (/rates)\nForms (/forms)\nPolicies (/policies)\nContacts (/contacts)\nTraining (/training)\nEvents (/events)\nNews & Announcements (/news)\n\u00a9 2019 Cornell University\nWeb Accessibility Help (mailto:rais-help@cornell.edu?subject=researchservices.cornell.edu%20site)"

The course meets all current federal requirements for research security training as well as Responsible Conduct of Research training requirements as set forth by federal agencies*. This training is a requirement of anyone who is named or paid on sponsored funds, and can be found here:CU601 - Responsible and Ethical Conduct of Research and Research Security. (https://www.myworkday.com/cornell/d/inst/15$374332/17815$710.htmld)\n*Please note that additional training requirements still apply for those researchers who work with animals or human subjects.\nRCR Training Announcement from the Office for the Vice President of Research and\nInnovation, Aug. 1, 2023:\n\nDear Colleagues,\nAs leaders of and contributors to academic research at Cornell, we know that the privilege of conducting academic research comes with the obligation to do so with responsible and ethical research practices. Cornell University shares in that responsibility, and provides materials aimed to ensure that all Cornell researchers understand both our ethical and legal obligations.\nIn addition, some federal agencies that sponsor research at Cornell also require those research leaders and participants to complete periodic training activities for Responsible and Ethical Conduct of Research (abbreviated RECR or RCR). Cornell is developing RCR materials, tailored to Cornell researchers, to make it easier for you to meet sponsor requirements while gaining the important RCR knowledge you need to lead and participate in research teams responsibly and ethically.\nCornell will be rolling out a new online RCR course\u2014developed specifically for Cornell researchers\u2014in early fall 2023.This course includes video (less than 30 minutes) and additional reading to do in our own time. Please watch for further communications and deadlines. Note that completion of Cornell\u2019s RCR course is a key requirement for all Cornell researchers \u2013 including, but not only, when research sponsors also require this certification. Those Cornellians who do not complete the required RCR training within 60 days of course assignment through CULearn, will need to do so before receiving new research funding, accepting new awards and submitting new proposals.\nFurther, please note that the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) has revised its regulatory requirements regarding training on RCR. Those revisions are now in effect. If you plan to submit a proposal for funding from the NSF, you may be impacted by this change. See below* for information about the regulatory change and how you can comply.\nIf you have any questions about how you can comply with the new NSF training requirements or if they apply to you, please feel free to contact Cornell\u2019s RCR office atrcr@cornell.edu. (mailto:rcr@cornell.edu)\nThank you,\nKrystyn J. Van Vliet, Vice President for Research & Innovation\n\n*New NSF RECR/RCR Requirements:For all proposals submitted or due on or after July 31, 2023,NSF requires that training on the responsible and ethical conduct of research, including training on mentorship, be taken by all undergraduate students, graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, faculty, and other senior personnel supported by NSF funds.\nNote that this requirement reflects two changes from prior years: (i) the RCR training requirement has expanded, and now applies to faculty and other senior personnel, and (ii) the training must include training on mentorship.\u00a0The new RCR Training meets these expanded requirements.\n\nQuick Reference\nRates (/rates)\nForms (/forms)\nPolicies (/policies)\nContacts (/contacts)\nTraining (/training)\nEvents (/events)\nNews & Announcements (/news)\n\u00a9 2019 Cornell University\nWeb Accessibility Help (mailto:rais-help@cornell.edu?subject=researchservices.cornell.edu%20site)"

The following provisions are effective now.\nAnnual or triennial continuing review (\"renewal\") is no longer needed for expedited protocols.\nThe most important change is that the annual renewal requirement has been eliminated for all expedited review studies.\nAs before, but even more important now, PIs must continue toseek approvalfor any changes to approved protocols by submittingamendments, and only begin procedures once amendments are approved by the IRB. Unexpected events must also be promptlyreported to the IRB. (/resources/submit-or-manage-your-irb-protocol, /forms/irb-amendment-form, /forms/irb-unexpected-event-report-form)\nEffective July 19: You do not need to complete a renewal request for approved expedited protocols\nIRB staff will contact PIs and faculty advisors prior to the scheduled expiration date of each protocol to remind them of the change to the policy and provide an updated approval letter and stamped consent documentation showing no expiration date. If you need to make any changes to your consent form, study materials or recruiting materials, submit an amendment to the IRB.\nIf you have received a reminder for annual review of have recently submitted a renewal application, you don't need to do anything at this time. The IRB staff will contact you.\nAt each anniversary of approval, you will receive a courtesy message from the IRB office, reminding you to keep your protocol updated, submit amendments as needed, report unexpected events and close the protocol when the study is over. While no action will be required on your part, we recommend that you take this opportunity to ensure that your study procedures are in compliance with your approved protocol.\nTwo other burden-reducing provisions of the Revised Common Rule are also now in effect.\nThe grant congruency process for HHS funding has been eliminated.\nA revised definition of regulated \"research,\" excepting journalism, oral history and similar activities. Cornell'scurrent interpretationis consistent with the new definition, so no change is anticipated. (/resources/irb-guidance-and-resources)\nThe grant congruency process for HHS funding has been eliminated. This change removes a significant administrative step for faculty and staff. PIs are responsible for making sure that research with human participants that is part of a project sponsored by the HHS (or any other agency) is approved by the IRB.\nNon-federally funded studies involving benign experiments may qualify for exemption using criteria from the Revised Common Rule that the IRB has chosen to apply early.\nThe IRB voted to allow exemptions to be issued for new, non-federally funded research that meets criteria described in certain new and expanded exemption categories in the Revised Common Rule.\nIn order to approach IRB reviews with greater flexibility, reducing administrative workload and regulatory burden without compromising the protection of human research subjects, the Cornell IRB limits the application of its Federal-wide Assurance (FWA) to federally funded research. Consistent with this approach, the IRB voted to allow exemptions to be issued for new, non-federally funded research that meets criteria described in certain new and expanded exemption categories in the Revised Common Rule, in advance of the January implementation date. If you submit an IRB application describing research that meets these criteria, IRB staff will issue an exemption, provided your application indicates that there is no current or anticipated federal funding for the study. No special actions are needed for your submission to be considered for exemption under these new/expanded criteria, which are described below:\nNew Exemption Category for \"Benign Behavioral Interventions\":The intervention must be \"brief in duration, harmless, painless, not physically invasive, not likely to have a significant adverse lasting impact on the subjects, and the investigator has no reason to think the subjects will find the interventions offensive or embarrassing.\" Example: having subjects solve puzzles under various noise conditions. Additional requirements:Adults only; no minors (under 18 years old)No direct or indirect identifiers are recorded or, if responses were disclosed outside the research setting, this would not reasonably place the subjects at risk of harmNo deception is permitted, unless the subject is told during the consent process that they will be unaware of or misled about the nature or purposes of the researchData collected can include verbal or written responses, data entry, observation, audiovisual recording. No data collection via physical procedures (EEG, FitBits, blood draw, etc.)\nAdults only; no minors (under 18 years old)\nNo direct or indirect identifiers are recorded or, if responses were disclosed outside the research setting, this would not reasonably place the subjects at risk of harm\nNo deception is permitted, unless the subject is told during the consent process that they will be unaware of or misled about the nature or purposes of the research\nData collected can include verbal or written responses, data entry, observation, audiovisual recording. No data collection via physical procedures (EEG, FitBits, blood draw, etc.)\nBroadened Exemption Category for Secondary Research:The exemption covering secondary research use of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens has been broadened so that the data no longer need to be existing (\"on the shelf\") when the exemption is granted.\nAs a reminder, all exempt studies require a formal determination of exemption before research with human participants begins. Researchers may not self-determine that their work is exempt, but must submit anapplication formto theIRB office. (/forms/irb-new-protocol-application-form, /offices/IRB)\nIf you have any questions or concerns about these changes to IRB processes, please do not hesitate tocontact the IRB office.

Research & Innovation will keep you informed of developments that could affect a large segment of Cornell researchers or the university as a whole.\nSeptember 2024:The university hasbegunthe process of collective bargaining with the United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America (UE), which represents a bargaining unit that includes TAs, GRAs, RAs and GAs at the Ithaca, Geneva, and Cornell Tech campuses. Additional information is available atResearch Continuity Planning: Graduate Assistant Unionizationand theGraduate Assistant Unionization Update website. (/resources/research-continuity-planning-faq-ga-unionization, https://unionupdate.gradschool.cornell.edu/)\nReviewthe roles that your research group members, such as graduate student advisees and research staff, play in the weekly activities and operations of your research. While each research group operates differently, here you should identify spots to be mindful of if individual research group members or segments of your research group were absent from virtual communication or physical presence due to an unexpected life circumstance.\nPreparea plan, considering several scenarios.Many of us are practiced at supporting our students and research continuity for our group or projects. In fact, some managed similar circumstances during the pandemic quarantine, maintaining and updating \"if/then\" plans when someone was out for a week unexpectedly. Others are newer to Cornell and research group leadership.Best practice for research continuity is to develop shared plans that the research group leader knows and communicates to the rest of their group members. In the event of a strike or other unexpected disruption, several research group members could be out at the same time, so your plans should reflect that scenario.Imagine situations beyond your typical lab or office boundaries. If your group conducts research activities that include human subjects, animals in research, or specialized equipment under your direct management or in shared facilities, additional considerations apply. Cornell Research & Innovation is here to help as you think through these possibilities, including theOffice of Research Integrity and Assurance (ORIA), which supports IRB, IACUC, and related research protocols and practices. You may be uncertain how some research activities include Cornell staff colleagues whose service roles continue during campus or global disruptions. ORIA colleagues can help clarify these matters to help with your planning.If you would like feedback on your scenario planning, discussions may be helpful with your department and field colleagues who may be practiced in such research adaptations. Often an \u201cif/then\u201d shorthand is shared among those whose research activities and locations are similar.Faculty seeking additional advice may reach out by email tofaculty colleagues in Research & Innovation.

(https://researchservices.cornell.edu/offices/ovpr)\nReviseas appropriate. Again, from collective experience in pandemic disruptions, research leaders will need to adapt as circumstances change. Best practices for the faculty leader include keeping your current plan handy and accessible and sharing with others in your research team.\nReach outtoyour Grant and Contract Officerspecifically or toResearch & Innovationmore generally if external research funders (e.g., federal sponsoring agency program directors) of your research projects or programs contact you. As in a pandemic disruption, sponsors may be curious or formally request updates on research project and budget impact. Research & Innovation will field these questions as needed, to enable timely and accurate responses for Cornell and to enable you to clearly focus on your research group members and activities.

(https://new.nsf.gov/policies/pappg/24-1/ch-2-proposal-preparation#ch2D2hiv)\nAll projects which include support for graduate students or Postdocs must have a one-page Mentoring Plan. The Plan must describe the mentoring that will be provided to all graduate students and PostDocs supported by the project, regardless of whether they reside at the submitting organization, any subrecipient organization, or at any organization participating in a simultaneously submitted collaborative proposal. If a project did not include a Mentoring Plan in their proposal but subsequently adds a graduate student or PostDoc to the project, a Mentoring Plan must be authored and sent to the assigned NSF Program Officer. SeePAPPG 24-1 Chapter II.D.2i(i). (https://new.nsf.gov/policies/pappg/24-1/ch-2-proposal-preparation#ch2D2i-i)\nAll projects which include substantial support (i.e., 1 month or more) for graduate students or Postdocs must have Individual Development Plans for Postdoctoral Scholars and Graduate Students. The Plan must address educational goals, career exploration, and professional development. A certification that a Plan is in place and is updated annually for each person will be added to the annual report in Research.gov. The Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP) is currently working on resources to help achieve this requirement and will provide updates to the Cornell research community via theWorking with NSF page. SeePAPPG 24-1 Chapter VII.B.7. (/resources/working-nsf, https://new.nsf.gov/policies/pappg/24-1/ch-7-award-administration#ch7B7)\nAll units must have on file a project specific planregarding the safe and inclusive working environmentsfor all projects that includes off-campus or off-site research. If a project did not include a Plan in their proposal but subsequently adds off-campus work, a Plan must be authored and retained by the unit. SeePAPPG 24-1 Chapter II.E.9.

These are also calledresearch awards, in the form of grants or contracts with external sponsors such as federal agencies, foundations, or companies.\nPublic announcements should occur only AFTER the grant or award agreement has been finalized by OSP and is in effect. Exceptions may be made if the sponsor provides written permission to announce the award before OSP finalizes the awardandthe Office of the Vice President for Research & Innovation approves the exception.\nHow long it takes to finalize an award\u00a0varies due to particularities of the award itself and the volume of awards that OSP is processing. Although OSP cannot predict when an award will be finalized, OSP may be able to provide information to help communicators plan and prepare so the public announcement can be ready for publication as soon as the award\u00a0is finalized. Emailosp-help@cornell.edufor assistance. (mailto:osp-help@cornell.edu)\nAward announcementsmust comply with the terms of the grant or award agreement. Emailosp-help@cornell.eduor contact the Grant and Contract Officer (GCO) to learn about any communications restrictions. The Lead PI will be able to provide the name of the GCO. (mailto:osp-help@cornell.edu)\nHow to Check Whether an Award Has Been Finalized\nEvery Cornell staff member with a NetID can determine whether an award has been finalized using the Research Administration Support System (RASS).\nNote: RASS includes awards to faculty who are based on Cornell\u2019s Ithaca, Geneva, and Cornell Tech campuses, as well as faculty at remote campuses such as the Duck Research Laboratory on Long Island and the Shoals Marine Laboratory in New Hampshire. It does not include Weill Cornell Medicine campuses in New York City or Qatar.\nGo torass.cornell.edu. (https://rass.cornell.edu/)\nLog in with your NetID.\nFrom theGrants & Contractsmenu, selectExplore Ithaca Awards. (This includes Ithaca, Geneva, and Cornell Tech campuses.)\nIn thePI/Co-PI field, type the name of a researcher affiliated with the award. Click the name of the PI you're searching for. (The PI/Co-PI is often the easiest way to search for an award, but you can also use project title, OSP #, or any other field.)\nClick the greenSearchbutton.\nA list of awards will appear at the bottom of the page. Find the award you are interested in.\nIfAwardappears in theStagecolumn ANDAward Finalizedappears in theStatuscolumn, the award\u00a0has been finalized.If you see anything in theStatuscolumn other thanAward Finalized, the award\u00a0has not been finalized.IfAward Amendmentappears in theStagecolumn, or if the award you\u2019re looking for does not appear at all, contactresearch@cornell.edufor information about whether the award is ready to be publicly announced.

(mailto:research@cornell.edu)\nOnce the award is finalized, emailosp-help@cornell.eduto ask whether the grant or award agreement restricts communications about the award.Note:\u00a0In some cases, the grant or award agreement may stipulate that the sponsor must be given an opportunity to review the announcement prior to publication. (mailto:osp-help@cornell.edu)\nAnnouncement Review and Approval\nThe Lead PI should always review the announcement prior to publication. To comply with the terms of the award, the sponsor may also need to review the announcement. If you are unsure who needs to review the announcement, emailosp-help@cornell.eduor contact the Grant and Contract Officer (GCO). The Lead PI will be able to provide the name of the GCO or you can find the GCO's name on the Explore Ithaca Awards page. (mailto:osp-help@cornell.edu)\nAnnouncements by Sub-Awardees\nIt is not unusual for a Cornell-led project to include funding for one or more researchers at other institutions (sub-awardees). Sub-awardees are expected to wait until Cornell has had an opportunity to announce the award before they announce the award themselves.\nCornell PIs may ask communicators for assistance in coordinating communications when Cornell-led projects involve sub-awardees.\nIf a Cornell researcher is a sub-awardee on a project led by another organization, contact the lead organization regarding public announcements about the award. You should expect the lead organization to coordinate communications regarding the award.\nAward Negotiation and Finalization (/manage/finalization)\nAnnouncing Externally Sponsored Awards: Guidance for Researchers (/policies/announcing-externally-sponsored-awards-guidance-researchers)\nTransfer an Award from Another Institution (/resources/transfer-award-another-institution)\nQuick Reference\nRates (/rates)\nForms (/forms)\nPolicies (/policies)\nContacts (/contacts)\nTraining (/training)\nEvents (/events)\nNews & Announcements (/news)\n\u00a9 2019 Cornell University\nWeb Accessibility Help (mailto:rais-help@cornell.edu?subject=researchservices.cornell.edu%20site)"

The Financial Conflict of Interest Committee has developed guidance to address how Cornell will manage potential conflicts for both Phase I and Phase II projects.\nSBIR and STTR are federal award mechanisms that allow start-up and small companies (referred to as Small Business Entities, or \u201cSBEs\u201d) to compete for federal funding. The goal of these awards is to engage these entities in federally- sponsored research and development and accelerate the transfer of scientific discovery and innovation to the public.\nSpecific requirements for each program are detailed in the Request for Proposal (RFP) and the STTR/SBIR websites of the awarding agency (NSF STTR/SBIR guidance;NIH guidance). Key differences between the programs are as follows: (https://seedfund.nsf.gov/, https://sbir.nih.gov/)\nFor STTR projects, the SBE must partner/collaborate with a research institution; no such requirement exists for SBIR projects.\nFor SBIR and some STTR projects (e.g., for STTRs from NSF), the PI at the SBE must be primarily employed at the SBE (effort for the SBE > 50%), unless a waiver is granted by the awarding agency (seereference link). (https://sbir.nih.gov/about/critical)\nCornell supports participation in SBIR/STTR programs by its faculty through an SBE, as this may allow faculty and their start-ups to make rapid progress towards commercialization of important inventions. However, a situation in which the faculty member or any member of the Cornell research team has a financial interest in the SBE applying for the funding and will also conduct research funded by the SBE, creates a conflict of interest (COI) for that individual. This COI could lead to the following types of problems:\nConcern that the individual may be using their Cornell lab, students, staff, funds or other Cornell resources to support their SBE, jeopardizing academic research and the progress of their students or staff; and\nBlurring of the non-profit/for-profit boundary (i.e., use of Cornell\u2019s tax-exempt facilities in a way that competitively advantages a for-profit SBE).\nAdditionally, if the SBE has licensed the IP from Cornell, this also presents the possibility of an institutional conflict of interest, whereby Cornell might benefit financially from the success of the SBE that has licensed its technology. Therefore, we must implement a COI management plan to manage not only the personal financial conflict of interest for the involved faculty, but also the institutional COI for Cornell.\nTo ensure that Cornell is able to support and conduct SBIR/STTR projects in a manner that is consistent with its principles of academic integrity, protection of students, open and fair publication of research results and in accordance with its tax-exempt status, all personnel must follow the guidelines below in applying for and executing SBIR/STTR projects.\nCase 1 - SBIR/STTR Phase I Project\nScenario: The SBE in which a Cornell researcher (hereafter referred to as \u201cCornell PI\u201d) has a financial interest, seeks Phase I SBIR or STTR funding, or a similar type of funding involving university and industry partnerships. The Cornell PI intends to conduct a portion of the work under a sub-award from the SBE to Cornell. SBIR Phase I awards normally do not exceed $150,000 in total costs and are for a period of 6 months.\nCOI Management Principle:While thefederal rules for COIregard Phase I SBIR projects as exempt from COI requirements, the principles that govern Cornell research and the issues identified above remain the same regardless of the type of funding. Therefore, Cornell policy does not exempt these relationships from review and requires the implementation of a conflict management plan (CMP). However, the terms of the CMP will reflect the relatively low risk of such relationships, as determined by the federal regulatory agencies, and in recognition of the university\u2019s commitment to encouraging and supporting efforts to bring university research to market.\nRequirements for Proposals and Awards\nThe Cornell PI is responsible for ensuring that the following requirements are met:\nThe Cornell PI may not also serve as the SBE PI on the SBE\u2019s proposal to the funding agency.\nThe SBE\u2019s proposal to the sponsor must clearly describe the relationship between the Cornell PI and the SBE, so that the sponsor can make the funding decision with full knowledge of the potential conflict.\nWhen submitting a proposal to the SBE for a sub-award to Cornell, the Cornell PI must provide to the Cornell OSP (1) a copy of the solicitation and the complete proposal and budget for the Cornell sub-contract and (2); the complete proposal submitted by the SBE to the prime sponsor (if not available at the time of submission, the documents should be provided immediately post- submission); and (3) indicate:the labs and other Cornell locations where work will be conducted;the role of any Cornell students and staff in the research;whether any SBE employees or representatives will be involved in the Cornell portion of the work and if so, a description of their involvement, including proposed activities at Cornell. These documents should, to the extent possible, be submitted to OSP along with the Form 10, and;documentation from the SBE that it has a primary operating space outside of Cornell University.NOTE: If the information is not provided in time for OSP to conduct a full review before submitting the proposal to the SBE sponsor, it must be provided before the award is received. If the proposal does not meet the requirements laid out in this document, OSP may need to withdraw the proposal, may not be able to accept the award from the SBE, or the award may need to be modified to comply with the COI management terms.\nthe labs and other Cornell locations where work will be conducted;\nthe role of any Cornell students and staff in the research;\nwhether any SBE employees or representatives will be involved in the Cornell portion of the work and if so, a description of their involvement, including proposed activities at Cornell. These documents should, to the extent possible, be submitted to OSP along with the Form 10, and;\ndocumentation from the SBE that it has a primary operating space outside of Cornell University.\nNOTE: If the information is not provided in time for OSP to conduct a full review before submitting the proposal to the SBE sponsor, it must be provided before the award is received. If the proposal does not meet the requirements laid out in this document, OSP may need to withdraw the proposal, may not be able to accept the award from the SBE, or the award may need to be modified to comply with the COI management terms.\nA Conflict Management Plan (CMP) must be in place for the Cornell PI before the sub-award from the SBE is accepted.\nInvolvement of Cornell personnel and resources on Cornell sub-award funded by the SBE\nAll Cornell individuals involved in the project- students, staff or other researchers- must be informed of the Cornell PI\u2019s relationship with the SBE before the award is accepted.\nStudents, staff and postdocs may be involved in the SBIR/STTR project only under the following conditions: (1) their involvement is approved by the FCOI Committee; (2) the DGS and their Special Committee have been informed of the relationship between the Cornell PI and the SBE; and (3) milestones for the students\u2019 progress toward their degrees have been established.\nPostdocs, students or staff involved in the SBIR/STTR project and working under the academic supervision of the Cornell faculty member may not also have a financial relationship with the SBE. The FCOI Committee must approve any exceptions to this rule.\nSBE employees or representatives may not use Cornell facilities or resources other than those that are routinely available on a fee for use basis, such as the central research centers, facilities specifically set aside for entrepreneurial work (e.g. the McGovern Center) or those open to the general public without fees, such as general use of the library.\nSBE employees may not be appointed as Visitors, Adjuncts, or Volunteers at the university, unless such appointments are approved by the FCOI Committee.\nCornell resources may be used only as described in the sub-award as long as those terms comply with University requirements.\nFinancial Controls\nThe Business Officer or Department Manager for the Cornell PI\u2019s department must be informed of the relationship between the SBE and the Cornell PI at the time of award.\nNo advance spending on these awards will be allowed. Money may not be spent on the award until the COI management plan has been finalized and the award has been finalized by OSP.\nAny purchases from, or other payments to, the SBE must be approved by the Conflict Manager.\nCase 2 - SBIR/STTR Phase II Project\nScenario:The SBE in which a Cornell PI has a financial interest seeks Phase II SBIR or STTR funding, or a similar type of funding involving university and industry partnerships. The Cornell PI wishes to conduct a portion of the work on this Phase II project under a sub-award from the SBE to Cornell.\nCOI Management Principle:Funding for Phase II projects is based on the results achieved in Phase I and on the scientific and technical merit and commercial potential of the project proposed. Funding is capped at a higher dollar amount of $1,000,000, and is provided over a longer period of time (2 years). Therefore, intersecting relationships for faculty involved in these projects present greater potential for a real financial interest in the outcome of the research. The CMP terms for a Conflict of Interest for the Cornell faculty member reflect this elevated risk.\nIn addition to the requirements for managing COI outlined in Case 1 above,the following conditions will apply:\nThe Cornell faculty may not serve as the sole PI on the SBE-funded project; a Cornell Co-PI, who has the same rights and responsibilities as the Cornell PI, must be appointed. This individual must not have a relationship with the SBE, must not be a subordinate of the Cornell PI, and must be mutually selected by the FCOI Committee, the Cornell PI, and the Conflict Manager.\nThe Co-PI must sign off on, and the Conflict Manager must review, budgets and any financial reports submitted to the sponsor.\nIf you have any questions about managing conflict of interest in SBIR/STTR projects, please contact theCOI office.

However, different sponsors provide research funding on different terms and with different stipulations; and Cornell\u2014in keeping with its land grant mission and commitment to the open dissemination of knowledge and discovery\u2014has policies and stipulations of its own. OSP will finalize a sponsored award only after it has ensured that the terms of the award align with Cornell policies and regulations. Furthermore, some sponsored awards involve a negotiated agreement between the sponsor and Cornell. The total amount and duration of funding and other terms may change during the negotiation process. In very rare instances, Cornell and the sponsor may not come to an agreement and the award cannot be accepted.\nTiming of Announcements\nPublic announcements should occur only AFTER the grant or award agreement has been finalized by OSP and is in effect. Once the grant or agreement is finalized, you will receive an email fromcu_awards@research.mail.cornell.edustating that the award has been finalized and your project has been awarded by the sponsor.\nNOTE: Although external sponsors often notify researchers verbally or by email once the researcher has been selected to receive a sponsored award, notification from the sponsor isnotthe same as a finalized grant or award agreement.\nExceptions to the guideline above may be made if the sponsor provides written permission to announce the\u00a0award before OSP finalizes the awardandthe Office of the Vice President for Research & Innovation approves the exception. Please forward written permission from the sponsor toosp-help@cornell.edufor review. (mailto:osp-help@cornell.edu)\nThese guidelines apply to all public announcements for publication in the Cornell Chronicle or other official Cornell outlets.\nFor Cornell-led sponsored awards that include sub-awardees at other universities or organizations, sub-awardees should NOT announce an award before the Cornell Chronicle or other official Cornell media outlet has published an announcement or has declined to do so. The Lead PI is responsible for communicating this expectation to sub-awardees.\nIf you need assistance communicating this expectation to sub-awardees or managing public announcements,your college or unit communications teamcan assist to help coordinate such communications among participating organizations. (https://universityrelations.cornell.edu/resources/comms-leads/)\nAdditional guidance for communicators may be found atAnnouncing Externally Sponsored Awards: Guidance for Communicators. (/policies/announcing-externally-sponsored-awards-guidance-communicators)\nIf you are a sub-awardee on a sponsored award led by a PI at another organization, you should expect coordination of communications from the Lead PI\u2019s organization.\nAnnouncements from Social Media Accounts, Lab Websites, etc.\nTo protect your relationship with sponsors, sponsored awards should NOT be announced through social media, public laboratory and faculty websites, public presentations, or other public communication platforms, spoken or print, until after OSP has finalized the\u00a0award.\nBefore making any public announcements, confirm that the grant or award agreement does not restrict such communications. The Additional Project Information PDF (attached with the notification from OSP that the award\u00a0has been finalized) will call attention to certain non-standard terms and conditions. If communications restrictions are not mentioned in the Highlighted Terms and Conditions, best practice is to check withyour Grant and Contract Officer (GCO)before publicly announcing the award. (/gco)\nThecommunications lead in your college or unitcan provide professional guidance on using social media, laboratory websites, and other public platforms to announce awards. (https://universityrelations.cornell.edu/resources/comms-leads/)\nSub-awardees and Other Research Personnel\nThe Lead PI of the sponsored award is responsible for communicating these guidelines to co-PIs, key personnel, individual and institutional sub-awardees, and other persons informed of a funding decision by an external sponsor. The Lead PI is the researcher who led the proposed project or program, and whose organization submitted that proposal to the sponsor or donor.\nQuestions?If you have questions about these guidelines, contact Mary-Margaret Klempa (mk636@cornell.edu), senior director of Cornell\u2019s Office of Sponsored Programs within the Office of the Vice President for Research & Innovation.

These activities are well aligned with Cornell\u2019s vision of being a global top-ten research university and its Land Grant mission. At the same time, however, such entrepreneurial activities present the possibility of bias in research,conflict of interest (COI), and/or conflict of commitment (COC), and these, if not handled properly, can threaten the integrity of research activity and the University\u2019s status as a recognized charitable educational organization.This document is focused on providing guidelines for Cornell researchers and entrepreneurs in starting companies while identifying and elevating potential conflicts. Mitigation of bias and undue influence in other situationsinvolving consulting for, owning financial interests in, and other engagements with industry and outside entitiesis handled in accordance with applicable Cornell policies and processes that must be followed by all Cornell researchers. (https://researchservices.cornell.edu/compliance/conflict-of-interest, https://researchservices.cornell.edu/forms/faculty-consulting-contract-addendum)\nContact the COI Officeif you have questions. (mailto:coi@cornell.edu)\nBiases and Conflicts\nBias is any tendency that prevents unprejudiced consideration of a question. For example, bias can be due to a real or perceived conflict of interest (COI) and can arise when Cornell Key Personnel, defined as any individual who participates in the design, purpose, conduct, or reporting of research, has a financial interest in a startup company involving their Cornell related research. Such potential conflicts, between the financial and research interests of the Key Personnel, must be managed properly to avoid bias or any appearance of influence or bias in research. The appearance of bias, even if not actually present, can damage the public research record by reducing the public trust in the reliability of published results.\nA common way bias appears in research is when Key Personnel exercise influence over subordinates to advance the interests of a startup company. Exercise of bias in this manner is called undue influence and must be avoided so that the integrity of the research record is not called into question. Undue influence can occur in a variety of situations. For the purpose of avoiding COIs in Cornell related research, we define undue influence as the use of the authority or the influence that a researcher has over staff, post-docs, students, or other subordinate members of their research team to gain unfair advantage or unfair benefit. These may include circumstances resulting in deleterious impacts to another team member, the university, or the public research record. Another type of conflict, called conflict of commitment (COC), can occur when an external commitment of a researcher interferes with their primary obligations to Cornell.\nConflict Management and CMPs\nThe Office of Research Integrity and Assurance (ORIA) works with researchers to establish Conflict Management Plans (CMPs) that appropriately address potential conflicts and the prospect of bias. The CMP sets forth obligations and actions that serve to reduce, mitigate, or eliminate actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest. In rare instances, a conflict may be unmanageable (meaning the conflict is not susceptible to effective management measures) and the Key Personnel will be required to either decline participation in either the startup company, or the Cornell research, or alternatively, the Key Personnel may make changes to their activities in a manner that eliminates the conflict or renders it manageable.\nAppropriate management of entrepreneurial activities is a key component of an effective COI program, and is it based on the following fundamental requirements:\nKey Personnel must not exert undue influence over students and staff under their supervision.\nKey Personnel with a responsibility to, or possibility of financial gain from, a company must not bias their research or other decisions made at Cornell to favor the company.\nCornell facilities and resources must not be used improperly (https://policy.cornell.edu/policy-library/personal-and-private-activity-using-university-property-and-facilities)\nCornell IP ownership must not be compromised (https://policy.cornell.edu/policy-library/inventions-and-related-property-rights)\nCornell\u2019s not-for-profit status must not be jeopardized; and\nPublic and sponsor trust in Cornell research must not be undermined.\nTo protect the integrity of the public research record and the interests of the University, theFinancial Conflicts of Interest (FCOI) Committeeand staff are charged with managing Conflicts of Interest (COI) and Conflicts of Commitment (COC). Within the limitations of this charge, the Committee and staff work to avoid compromising researchers aspirations to startup companies as much as possible. It is also the Committee\u2019s responsibility to protect Key Personnel, and startup companies against conflicts with pre-existing duties and commitments to Cornell. As a result, COI and COC issues related to Key Personnel ownership of, and participation in, commercial ventures, constitute a large proportion of the FCOI Committee\u2019s work. (https://researchservices.cornell.edu/resources/financial-conflicts-interest-committee)\nSuccessful COI and COC management requires that all parties take an active role in the process. Specifically:\nEntrepreneurs must contemporaneously report changes in circumstances that implicate bias or the potential for undue influence preferably in advance of the anticipated change in circumstances.\nCOI staff must implement a Conflict Management Plan (CMP) whenever required.\nCMPs must be reviewed and updated whenever opportunities for influence are introduced.\nThe FCOI Committee must make decisions about whether a CMP is needed, and therefore, they must have access to the respective roles of startup company employees, and the respective board members and advisors.\nIn order to appropriately manage CMPs related to companies in Cornell incubators, the Director of the incubator will have a role in the CMPs regarding relevant communications with the Conflict Manager and COI staff but will not enforce or manage CMPs.\nGuidelines for Cornell Entrepreneurs (#Guidance)\nTo ensure transparency and timely resolution of COI and COC issues related to entrepreneurship, the FCOI Committee provides the following guidelines for adhering to the fundamental requirements.\nAvoiding undue influence:\nAs stated above, when a Cornell startup company is also involved in Cornell research, the possibility exists for real or perceived undue influence over students, staff, postdocs, and others. This influence can be to the detriment of the person influenced as well as the underlying research. Any member of the Cornell community possessing a financial interest (e.g., equity) in the company has the potential to exert such influence over peers or those under their supervision, even if they do not have an official position with the company. Students are especially susceptible to undue influence due to the consequences of performance evaluation. Postdocs are susceptible as well, but perhaps to a lesser degree, as they have somewhat more control over their career than do students. To prevent undue influence, or a reasonable perception of undue influence:\nGraduate students and their supervising faculty members are prohibited from jointly founding a company, or working together in a company until the students have graduated.\nPostdocs and their faculty advisor may only work together in a startup company in which either has or plans to have an equity stake, for a period of no more than one year. The postdoc may be required to reduce their Cornell appointment to account for the time spent at the company.\nReporting COI/COC events and CMP updates:\nActual, and equally important, perceived COI and COC may take different forms at different stages in the evolution of a company from technology discovery to product commercialization.\nOnce notified, COI staff will review and determinewhether a CMP is neededat this stage. If the company is unrelated to the Key Personnel\u2019s Cornell research or the purpose of founding the company is solely to apply for SBIR or STTR grants and no other work is planned until such a grant is obtained, then a CMP may not be necessary. However, a CMP is required if postdocs supervised by the founders are involved in the company in any way. (https://researchservices.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/L1%20CMP%20Template_0.pdf)\nThe CMP must be reviewed and updated whenever circumstances implicating bias or undue influence change. It is not acceptable to wait for the required annual review to make significant updates. It is the responsibility of the Key Personnel to notify the COI staff of a change in circumstance, preferably in advance of its onset, but no more than 30 days after the COI event. Circumstances requiring (preferably advance) review of circumstances and an applicable CMP include, but are not limited to:\nFounding a company. Founding a company is an event which changes the COI status of the founding member(s) and must bereported to the COI office. It is not acceptable to simply update the COI report annually. (mailto:coi@cornell.edu)\nWhen a Cornell license agreement is to be negotiated with the startup.\nWhen a startup, in which a Cornell researcher has an equity interest, applies to enter a Cornell incubator, the researcher has an obligation to notify COI staff in writing and have their CMP reviewed.\nWhen Key Personnel go on a leave of absence to work at the subject company.\nWhen Key Personnel return from such a leave of absence.\nWhen a Key Personnel has equity in a startup and a person supervised by that Key Personnel intends to enter into a relationship with the startup, or an employee of the startup intends to enter Cornell under the Key Personnel\u2019s supervision.\nWhen the startup proposes to fund work or research at Cornell, directly or through a subcontract from a sponsor.\nOn occasion, Key Personnel who are founders of a startup want to give the startup access to equipment in that founder\u2019s lab. These uses implicate Private Use and potentially compromise Cornell\u2019s tax-exempt status. Such uses must, therefore, be reconciled with Policy 4.19 and approved by the Vice President for Research and Innovation (VPRI) in consultation with the Office of General Counsel.\nCompany Leadership and Leaves of Absence:\nThere is an initial stage in the formation of a company where it is unreasonable to prevent Key Personnel from taking a leadership role in the company as this would unreasonably limit the likelihood of success of the company. However, some external activities of Key Personnel can be incompatible with their primary employment obligations to Cornell.\nKey Personnelmay serve as consultant, advisor, or a member of the Scientific Advisory Board at a company as permitted by their appointment (for faculty, this means one day per week of external activity). As with all external activities, Key Personnel must continue to satisfy their pre-existing employment obligations to Cornell. Key Personnel cannot serve as President, CEO, or in any other fiduciary role (e.g., COO, CSO, CTO) at a startup without taking a leave of absence to do so. An exception may be approved by the FCOIC in the case of an early-stage company. A company is unlikely to be considered early stage if it:\na. Has employees, or;\nb. Has sales of products or services, or;\nc. Has received total funding or expenditures greater than $500,000, or;\nd. Has been in existence for two years or more.\nKey Personnel may serve on the Board of Directors of an early-stage\u00a0company with the approval\u00a0of the COI Office. Key Personnel may serve on the Board of Directors at a\u00a0company that is not considered early-stage, only if the following conditions are met:A Conflict Management Plan (CMP) is put in place that meets the following requirements:(1) The time spent in the discharge of duties as a Board member will be within the Cornell consulting allowance.(2) Board member roles in which Key Personnel are performing executive duties, regardless of title, will not be allowed.(3) The Key Personnel cannot negotiate with Cornell on behalf of the company or influence Cornell or its faculty to advance the interests of the company.\u200b\u200b\u200bA full disclosure, including a copy of the contract or other agreement defining the Board role, will be required from the Key Personnel regarding their responsibilities as a Board member so that a CMP can be enforced effectively.Key Personnel must include theContract Addendum, signed and acceptable to\u00a0Cornell, in their contract with the company\u00a0to ensure that no clauses contained in the contract conflict with any pre-existing primary employment obligations to Cornell, or those obligations and attestations owed to the federal funding agencies and the U.S. government.The Financial Conflict of Interest Committee (FCOIC) approves the CMP and Board appointment.

(https://researchservices.cornell.edu/forms/faculty-consulting-contract-addendum)\nThe Financial Conflict of Interest Committee (FCOIC) approves the CMP and Board appointment.\nAccess to Startup Information:\nTo make informed decisions, the FCOI Committee will, in some cases, need to understand the roles of startup company\u2019s employees and members of the boards of directors and advisors. The University does not require access to sensitive company business or technical information, but it does require sufficient information to make appropriately informed decisions related to the COI and COC issues presented, and to secure company and researcher affirmation regarding the subject conflicts identified.\nCompany Personnel:\nEarly-stage startups often desire access to equipment in founders\u2019 labs and may sometimes desire to work in the founder\u2019s lab. Such uses implicate Cornell\u2019s tax-exempt status and must be reconciled with Policy 4.19 and approved by the VPRI in consultation with the Office of General Counsel.\nIncubators:\nFor companies in a Cornell incubator, Incubator Directors are generally aware of situations involving conflict management. Although it may not be necessary for the Director to be privy to the full contents of the CMP, the Director will be associated with the CMP in a manner that allows for the Director to know when the CMP is approved or changed. The Director will also need enough information to enable the communication of comments and observations to the Conflict Manager and COI staff. Specific details will be populated on a case-by-case basis.\nAdherence to these guidelines will significantly reduce the time and effort required to identify and manage COI and COC issues that arise in entrepreneurship within the Cornell community.\nConflicts of Interest (/compliance/conflict-of-interest)\nFCOI Guidance on Research Involving Human Participants (/policies/fcoi-guidance-research-involving-human-participants)\nSample Disclosures for Managed Conflicts (/forms/sample-disclosures-managed-conflicts)\nFaculty Consulting / Contract Addendum (/forms/faculty-consulting-contract-addendum)\nFCOI Guidance on Consulting and Other External Engagements (/policies/fcoi-guidance-consulting-and-other-external-engagements)\nFinancial Conflicts of Interest Committee (/resources/financial-conflicts-interest-committee)\nReport a COI Concern (/resources/report-coi-concern)\nQuick Reference\nRates (/rates)\nForms (/forms)\nPolicies (/policies)\nContacts (/contacts)\nTraining (/training)\nEvents (/events)\nNews & Announcements (/news)\n\u00a9 2019 Cornell University\nWeb Accessibility Help (mailto:rais-help@cornell.edu?subject=researchservices.cornell.edu%20site)"

(https://www.dfa.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/policy/vol1_7.pdf, /resources/financial-conflicts-interest-committee, /resources/how-are-conflicts-interest-reviewed-and-managed)\nA critical step in managing any FCOI is the appointment of a Conflict Manager (CM). \u00a0It is the duty of the CM to oversee compliance with the CMP, serve as a resource for the individual whose conflict is under management, and act as a liaison to the Conflict of Interest office.\nWho may serve as a Conflict Manager\nThe FCOIC implements a CMP and appoints a CM for each individual whose external interests may present a FCOI. Typically, the Chair of a Cornell department is asked to serve as the CM for any CMP involving individuals in his or her department.\u00a0 If, however, the Chair has a relationship with the entity described in the CMP (for example, a financial interest or an advisory role) or participates directly in the research covered by the CMP (for example, as a collaborator, advisor, or reviewer), then in consultation with the college leadership and the managed individual, the FCOIC may call upon another senior member of the faculty or staff, unaffiliated with the research or the external entity, to serve as the CM.\nRole of the Conflict Manager\nIt is the role of the CM to oversee compliance with the CMP and serve as a resource for the individual whose conflicts are under management, as well as to staff and students affected by the research.\u00a0 This guidance outlines the specific responsibilities of a CM, however recognizing that it is not possible to cover every possible instance that may arise in the course of managing a conflict, CMs should consult with the Cornell COI office for guidance on specific matters.\nSpecific duties of the CM are as follows:\nensure that appropriate disclosures have been made to students, employees, collaborators, publishers, and in conferences as required in the CMP;\nmeet with the managed individual\u2019s students annually to discuss any concerns related to the managed relationship;\nmeet with the managed individual annually or as required by the FCOIC, to assess compliance with the terms of the CMP;\nsubmit an annual report of compliance with the terms of the CMP, including a copy of the completed checklist included in the CMP, to the FCOIC;\nserve as a liaison between the FCOIC and the managed individual to implement any changes to the CMP that are required due to changes in circumstances or relationship between the managed individual and the entity, or between their research and the entity;\nreview and approve any proposed purchases of products or services by the managed individual or his or her staff or students, from the entity;\nreport to the COI office any concerns raised by students, employees, or collaborators concerning the FCOI managed under the CMP or research that is related to the managed entity, and partner with the FCOIC as necessary to address and resolve those concerns\nIf the entity seeks to sponsor Cornell research under the supervision of the managed individual, the CM may be required to provide additional oversight, such as:\nreview and sign-off on budget expenditures and budget reports for Cornell research that is sponsored by the managed entity;\nif the managed individual acts as the Chair or member of the Special Committee of any graduate student who will be working on projects funded by the managed entity, meet with the Special Committee at the initiation of the project or within 30 days of the execution of the CMP to make sure that all members are made aware of and review the CMP, and are aware of their responsibility to take adequate measures to protect the student\u2019s progress and ability to publish and meet degree requirements;\nif the FCOIC requires the appointment of a Co-PI for an entity-sponsored project, assist in identifying an appropriate person to serve as the Co-PI and ensure that the Co-PI is able to execute his/her responsibilities to the project as required by the sponsor and the FCOIC\nIf the managed individual seeks to issue a sub-award to the entity with which s/he has the managed relationship, the CM will:\nReview and approve any increases over $5,000 in sub-award funding to the entity\nAdditional Information\nFor additional information about the role of the Conflict Manager, please contact theCOI Office.

Do you have a financial relationship with an entity that is also funding your research, or might benefit from your research? The Financial Conflict of Interest (FCOI) Committee has developed guidance for you perUniversity Policy 1.7, Financial Conflict of Interest Related to Research. (https://policy.cornell.edu/policy-library/financial-conflict-interest-related-research)\nGuidelines for Involving Human Participants\nWhen submitting the required COI report through RASS-COI, consider the following questions:\nDoes the research you participate in involve human participants?\nDo you have a financial relationship with a company or organization that is funding your research, directly involved in your research, or otherwise might benefit from your research?\nConsistent with University Policy 1.7, in the event that a conflict of interest exists that is related to human participant research, a conflict management plan (CMP) must be put into place, and must include additional protections for human participants.The Cornell Institutional Review Board (IRB), which is responsible for ensuring that the interests of research participants are protected, has the final authority in determining the conditions under which such research is allowable.In such cases, at minimum, the restrictions listed below must be implemented in order for research to be potentially approved by the IRB.In exceptional cases, theFCOI Committeeand the IRB may elect to waive some of these restrictions if they believe that these conditions will not be in the best interests of the human participants: (https://researchservices.cornell.edu/resources/about-irb-committee, https://researchservices.cornell.edu/resources/financial-conflicts-interest-committee)\nThe conflicted researcher may not serve as the principal investigator (PI) for the research. Another individual who does not report to the researcher and does not have a financial interest in the company must serve as the PI.\nThe researcher may not be involved in the informed consent or data/sample collection processes with participants.\nIn some instances, including clinical trials, the data may need to go through an independent review by a third party approved by the FCOI Committee.\nDuring the informed consent process, participants must be informed of the researcher\u2019s relationship with the entity and, if relevant, of the steps that are being taken to protect their interests and the integrity of the research.\nThe CMP must be put into place before conflicted research personnel can participate in the design or conduct of the research, enrollment of participants, or analysis of the results. For new projects, the IRB protocol will only be approved once the CMP has been implemented. For previously-approved projects where a new conflict has arisen, the protocol\u2019s IRB approval will be paused until the CMP has been implemented. Failure to abide by the terms laid out in a CMP may result in sanctions for non-compliance with Cornell policy.\nIf you have questions, please write to the COI and IRB offices viacoi@cornell.eduandirbhp@cornell.edu.

The Financial Conflicts of Interest Committee has developed guidance for theIthaca Campus (including Cornell Tech).\nThe University unequivocally supports the efforts of itsfaculty and research staffto foster productive relationships with the world outside Cornell, including acting as consultants and in other external engagements. In undertaking such activities,faculty and research staffmust be attentive to their obligations to Cornell and take appropriate steps to ensure that such activities do not take precedence over their primary commitment to the University.\nSince no guidance can address every instance of outside professional activities, thefacultyor research staff member must engage in those professional outside activities that promote and support Cornell\u2019s commitment to pedagogy, research, and service. Whenever uncertainty exists, guidance and prior consent from the appropriate University office must be obtained.\nFor guidance specific to the Weill campus, please contact theWCMC Office of Research Integrity and Assurance. (https://research.weill.cornell.edu/integrity-compliance/conflict-management-office)\nContractual Agreements\nCornell's Contract Addendum, unaltered, must be included in all consulting and other external contracts.

In response to these perceived threats from foreign governments, new policies and regulations are being promulgated by these agencies to ensure disclosure of U.S. participation with foreign entities and actors.\nIn May 2019, Cornell\u2019s Vice Provost for Research and Vice Provost for International Affairs issued a memo to the Cornell research community reaffirming Cornell\u2019s commitment to international partnerships and activities, and summarizing best practices and resources available to support Cornell researchers. To read more, please reviewCornell\u2019s Global Engagement Memo \u2013 May 2019. (/news/concerns-about-undue-foreign-influence-guidance-cornell-community)\nWhile Cornell\u2019s commitment to international collaborations and global engagement remains unchanged, there are certain steps that Cornell and other U.S. universities must take to ensure compliance with existing regulations and requirements. Federal guidance on foreign influence places significant importance on transparency in research activities and the disclosure of relationships with international partners and collaborators. To assist Cornell researchers and research administrators with meeting these transparency requirements, the information below provides a summary of obligations to federal sponsors and Cornell.\nWhat are federal agencies saying?\nSeveral federal agencies have issued statements regarding the U.S. Government\u2019s commitment to safeguarding U.S-based research and intellectual property, and reiterating the disclosure obligations associated with federally funded work. \u00a0Much of the focus has been on the failure by some federally funded researchers in the US to disclose resources from other organizations. The message from the federal funding agencies is clear:investigators and their universities must completely disclose all research support and foreign activities to their federal funding sponsors through documentation of other support/current and pending, CV/biosketch, foreign components, and financial conflict of interest\nMost significantly, these clarified requirements extend the scope of required reporting beyond that which is attributable to an investigator\u2019s affiliation with Cornell as\u00a0disclosure requirements are now agnostic as to the source or location of other support. No longer can researchers or their administrators rely solely on Cornell\u2019s records to generate a Current & Pending document. Instead, investigators must complete and update their Current & Pending document based on the totality of their research support, both within and outside of Cornell.\nDisclosing Foreign Activities to Cornell\nAnnual Conflict of Interest Disclosure\nAs part of the annual financial conflict of interest disclosure, researchers are required to report the time they have spent working for, consulting with, or traveling for non-Cornell entities regardless of compensation for these activities. This information is required for Conflict of Commitment reporting to Departments and Colleges and to identify possible foreign influences on research integrity. Disclosures should include:\nVisiting or other academic positions at domestic and foreign institutions\nWork or travel on behalf of any of the following, whether domestic or foreign;academic institutions (other than Cornell)U.S. and foreign governmentsnon-profits/foundationsindustry or trade groupsprivate or public companies (including as an investor or any other role)\nacademic institutions (other than Cornell)\nU.S. and foreign governments\nnon-profits/foundations\nindustry or trade groups\nprivate or public companies (including as an investor or any other role)\nDomestic and foreign consulting relationships\nDisclosures do not need to include travel for the sole purpose of a personal vacation or to attend a conference.\nProposal Submission\nEach proposal submission by Cornell should be completed in RASS. In addition to capturing project information and approvals, this system includes a\u00a0checkbox to record foreign activities related to the project. Such activities may include foreign collaborators, foreign consultants, subcontracts to foreign entities, overseas shipments, or travel to foreign countries. This checkbox will alert Grant & Contract Officers who may advise that consultation with other Cornell offices (i.e.Global Operationsor theExport Control Office) is necessary or helpful to the success of the project. (/forms/rass-form-10-phased-out, https://global.cornell.edu/resources/global-operations, /offices/export-controls-office)\nDisclosing Foreign Activities to External Sponsors\nDisclosing Foreign Affiliations in CV/Biosketch\nMany federal agencies, including NIH, have cited foreign government-sponsored talent recruitment programs as a perceived threat to U.S. research. Participation in these foreign talent recruitment programs often involves academic or research affiliations with foreign institutions, financial or other in-kind support for a U.S. researcher\u2019s program, and commitments of time and resources from the U.S. researcher. As such, both the federal sponsors and Cornell require disclosure of participation in foreign talent recruitment programs. Please seehere for the DOE\u2019s definition of a foreign talent program. (https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/January%20DOE%20memo.pdf)\nResearchers must list all positions and scientific appointments both domestic and foreign, including affiliations with foreign entities or governments. This includes titled academic, professional or institutional appointments whether or not remuneration is received, and whether full-time, part-time or voluntary (including adjunct, visiting, or honorary) in their CV/Biosketch.\nDisclosing Foreign Activities to NSF in Current & Pending and Biographical Sketch\nFor details, seeNSF: Disclosing Current & Pending Support, Biographical Sketches, and International Partnerships. (/policies/nsf-disclosing-current-pending-support-biographical-sketches-and-international)\nDisclosing Foreign Activities to NIH as Other Support\nFor details, see theNIH: Disclosing Other Support and Foreign Components. (/policies/nih-disclosing-other-support-and-foreign-components)\nNIH requires all senior/key personnel to disclose all resources made available to a researcher in support of and/or related to all of their research endeavors, regardless of whether or not they have monetary value and regardless of whether they are based at the institution the researcher identifies for the current grant. This means that even if the researcher performs the activity outside of their Cornell employment or at a location other than Cornell, the researcher must disclose the activity to NIH if it supports or relates to their research endeavors.\nExamples of Other Support include, but are not limited to, the following when they are in support of an investigator\u2019s research endeavors:\nDomestic and foreign grants and contracts, whether provided through Cornell, another institution, or to the researcher directly\nFinancial support for laboratory personnel (e.g., students, postdocs, or scholars working in a researcher\u2019s lab at Cornell and who are supported by a foreign entity either through salary, stipend, or receipt of living or travel expenses)\nProvision of lab space at another institution, foreign or domestic\nProvision of scientific materials that are not freely available for use at Cornell or another institution where the faculty is working (e.g., biologics, chemical, model systems, technology, equipment, etc.)\nTravel expenses directly paid or reimbursed by a an outside entity\nLiving expenses directly paid or reimbursed by an outside entity\nOther funding (e.g., salary, stipend, honoraria, etc.) paid to a Cornell researcher by an outside entity.This includes resource and/or financial support from all foreign and domestic entities, including but not limited to, financial support for laboratory personnel, and provision of high-value materials that are not freely available (e.g., biologics, chemical, model systems, technology, etc.).\nBecause the scope of required disclosure is not limited to those research activities at Cornell, researchers must take an active role in reviewing their Other Support documents to ensure that all necessary disclosures have been made. While Cornell administrators can assist in identifying Cornell related activities, all outside activities must be compiled by the researcher for inclusion in the Other Support document.\nDisclosing Foreign Activities to NIH as Foreign Component\nFor details, seeNIH: Disclosing Other Support and Foreign Components. (/node/7866)\nNIH defines Foreign Componentas the performance of any significant scientific element or segment of a project outside of the United States, either by the recipient or by a researcher employed by a foreign organization,whether or not grant funds are expended. (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/glossary.htm#ForeignComponent)\nActivities that would meet this definition include, but are not limited to;\nthe involvement of human subjects or animals\nextensive foreign travel by recipient project staff for the purpose of data collection, surveying, sampling, and similar activities\nany activity of the recipient that may have an impact on U.S. foreign policy through involvement in the affairs or environment of a foreign country\nExamples of activities that may be considered a significant element include;\ncollaborations with investigators at a foreign site anticipated to result in co-authorship\nuse of facilities or instrumentation at a foreign site\nreceipt of financial support or resources from a foreign entity\nForeign Components in Proposal Submissions:Applications which include a foreign component must answer yes toQuestion 6 of the R&R Other Project Information Formand include a \"Foreign Justification\" inField 12, Other Attachmentsof the same R&R Other Project Information Form. This justification must describe the special resources or characteristics of the research project to outline why the facilities or other aspects of the proposed project are more appropriate at a foreign rather than a domestic setting.

The PAM program is designed to be a collaborative partnership between the IACUC and animal users to ensure investigators reach their scientific goals while promoting the highest standards of animal well-being and fostering a culture of compliance.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS1.Policy2.Procedures3.References (#policy, #Procedures, #References)\n1) Policy\nA. The purpose of the Post Approval Monitoring (PAM) program is to regularly monitor research and teaching activities involving live, vertebrate animals and ensure compliance with all applicable regulations and policies while maintaining accreditation with AAALAC International.\nB. PAM is considered a form of continuous IACUC review. According toThe Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals 8th Edition (pg.33):\u201cContinuing IACUC oversight of animal activities is required by federal laws, regulations, and policies.\u201d (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/Guide-for-the-Care-and-Use-of-Laboratory-Animals.pdf)\nC. Deficiencies or deviations from approved IACUC protocols and amendments will be noted and corrective actions and timelines will be established. Any animal welfare concerns will be immediately reported to the Attending Veterinarian (AV), the IACUC Chair, and the Director of Research Assurance.\nD. The goals of the PAM program are to enhance animal welfare by:\nActing as an educational resource for the academic and scientific community.\nFostering a positive relationship for collaborative dialogue to exchange information between the IACUC and those who carry out research and teaching activities.\nHelping researchers remain compliant with the requirements of funding agencies, regulatory bodies, and institutional policies while ensuring that protocol activities are conducted as outlined in an approved IACUC protocol.\n2) Procedures\nA.\u00a0 Regulations and Guidelines Used for PAM Visits:\nAnimal Welfare Act and Regulations (https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_welfare/downloads/AC_BlueBook_AWA_508_comp_version.pdf)\nPHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (https://olaw.nih.gov/policies-laws/phs-policy.htm)\nThe Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/guide-for-the-care-and-use-of-laboratory-animals.pdf)\nAVMA Guidelines on Euthanasia (https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/2020-02/Guidelines-on-Euthanasia-2020.pdf)\nGuide for the Care and Use of Agricultural Animals in Research and Teaching (https://www.asas.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/agguide_4th.pdf?sfvrsn=56b44ed1_2)\nCornell Animal Care and Use Procedures (ACUPs) (https://researchservices.cornell.edu/resources/regulations-and-guidance-use-live-vertebrate-animals-acup-iacuc-policies#ACUPS)\nIACUC Policies, SOPs, ABPs, and Guidelines (https://researchservices.cornell.edu/resources/regulations-and-guidance-use-live-vertebrate-animals-acup-iacuc-policies?check_logged_in=1&ACUPS)\nB.\u00a0 PAM Overview\nThe PAM program is designed to be minimally disruptive to ongoing work in the animal space. Assessments should be viewed as a collegial training opportunity to support the health and well-being of animals and refine research and teaching procedures.\nPAM isgenerally performed by a Research Compliance Liaison who is considered to be an expert in assessing compliance with regulations, approved protocols, and procedural documents. On some occasions, \u00a0CARE veterinarians may also perform PAM in coordination with the Research Compliance Liaison. Other subject matter experts may be included in the PAM process.\nC.\u00a0 Selection Process\nAll active Cornell University IACUC protocols are eligible for review. Protocols may also be reviewed at the request of any member of the IACUC, at the recommendation of the Attending Veterinarian (AV), or as a result of an external regulatory inspection/site visit.\nProtocols that fall within the following categories may be subject to more frequent review:\nStudies classified as Pain Category D and E,\nStudies or research groups that have experienced past compliance issues.\nD. PAM visits\nPAM visits will typically include an in-person meeting with the PI and senior laboratory staff to facilitate dialogue and to meet the goals of the PAM program. All individuals listed on the protocol(s) are encouraged to attend.\nPAM visits include any or all the following:\nA.\u00a0 Protocol and Records Review & Discussion\nEntrance interview with PI and/or senior laboratory management\nReview of currently approved protocol(s)\nAudit of personnel qualifications and training logs and Animal User Health and Safety Program (AUHSP) clearance\nReview of procedure records for consistency with approved protocols\nReview of animal use/experiment areas to evaluate proper animal care\nReview of animal number and experimental records\nReview of protocol exemptions\nB.\u00a0 Procedure Observations\nObservation of the presence and condition of equipment and supplies required to safeguard the care of the research animals\nPre- and post-procedure care\nAnimal manipulations\nTransportation of animals between housing and use locations\nReview of non-pharmaceutical substances and drug expiration dates\nReview of euthanasia methods (if applicable)\nC.\u00a0 Surgical Observations\nSurgical area appropriateness\nSanitation procedures\nControlled drug inventory and use\nEmergency protocols for adverse events\nAnesthesia equipment\nAnesthetic and analgesic regimens\nConduct of major surgeries\nPost-operative care\nE.\u00a0 Scheduling a PAM Visit\nThe Principal Investigator will be sent an e-mail explaining the reason for the request and providing details about the PAM visit planned and who will be attending.\nA mutually agreeable time for the PAM visit will be established. Pertinent documentation may be requested prior to the visit.\nA compliance checklist will be provided to the PI prior to the in-person visit.\nF.\u00a0 Preparing for the PAM Visit\nPrior to the PAM visit, PAM personnel will review relevant protocols and IACUC policies and guidelines.\nPAM personnel will compare procedures described in the approved protocols with current regulatory requirements and standards.\nIt is strongly recommended that the PI and staff members review relevant IACUC protocols, policies and guidelines, and the compliance checklist.\nG.\u00a0 Conducting the PAM visit\nPost Approval Monitoring will consist of an assessment of a team\u2019s adherence to approved protocols and may include observation of select surgeries and procedures. Typically, the visit will be scheduled for one hour, but will depend on the visit\u2019s focus. The compliance checklist will be used as an outline during the visit\nExit Briefing\na. The PAM personnel will provide an exit briefing to the PI and/or members of the laboratory to ensure the accuracy of the observations.\nb. This communication will recognize successful performance and if necessary, identify possible deviations from protocols or problematic areas that may require corrective action.\nc. PAM personnel may make reasonable and practical suggestions for correcting non-compliance.\nd. Recommendations made by PAM personnel at the time of the exit briefing are not considered final until reviewed and discussed by the PAM subcommittee (see below) and/or IACUC.\n3. Post-visit Communication\na. Any animal welfare concerns will be immediately reported to the AV, the IACUC Chair, and the Director of Research Assurance.\nb.A PAM summary will be prepared and reviewed by the PAM subcommittee which includes, the Director of Research Assurance, the Attending Veterinarian, and the IACUC Chair or their delegates. This subcommittee will determine whether any reported issues require a full IACUC review, and if so, the IACUC will determine whether the issues are reportable to regulatory agencies.\nc.The PI is given the opportunity to make improvements by refining techniques and/or by submitting an amendment to the IACUC.\nd.The PI will be informed if any further actions are needed.\n4.Informing the IACUC Committee\na.The Research Compliance Liaison will provide a summary to the IACUC, at least twice a year, outlining the PAM visits that were performed.\nb.If deemed necessary, the IACUC may require a follow-up PAM visit.\n3.

Compliance with the CoC is a\u00a0term and condition of all NIH awards.This policy applies to NIH funded Grants, Cooperative Agreements, R&D Contracts, and Awards. (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-17-109.html)\nCertificate of Confidentiality (CoC):A CoC protects the privacy of research participants by prohibiting disclosure of names or any other identifiable, sensitive information in response to legal demands for access to the data, such as a subpoena.\nIdentifiable, sensitive information:NIH defines \u201cidentifiable, sensitive information\u201d as the following:\nBiospecimens or information gathered or used for research purposes, through which an individual is identified; or\nFor which there is at least a very small riskthat some combination of the biospecimen/information, a request for the biospecimen/information, and other available data sources could be used to deduce the identity of an individual.While the definition includes the qualifier \u201csensitive,\u201d NIH has clarified that it intends for a CoC to protect data, regardless of its nature (i.e., even for data considered to be benign).\nResearch covered by a CoC:Research data or information related to research that meets any of the criteria below is automatically protected by a CoC from NIH:\nNIH funded research in which identifiable, sensitive information is collected or used, including research that:Meets the definition ofhuman subjects research, including exempt research in which subjects can be identified;Is collecting or using human biospecimens that are identifiable or that have a risk of being identifiable;Involves the generation of individual level human genomic data (regardless of identifiability); orInvolves any other information that might identify a person. (https://researchservices.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/2019-05/IRB%20Decision%20Tree.pdf)\nMeets the definition ofhuman subjects research, including exempt research in which subjects can be identified; (https://researchservices.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/2019-05/IRB%20Decision%20Tree.pdf)\nIs collecting or using human biospecimens that are identifiable or that have a risk of being identifiable;\nInvolves the generation of individual level human genomic data (regardless of identifiability); or\nInvolves any other information that might identify a person.\nSeeAppendix Afor a decision tree. (#AppendixA)\nResearcher responsibilities for research covered by a CoC:\nONLY disclose identifiable, sensitive information in the following circumstances:if required by other Federal, State, or local laws, such as for reporting of communicable diseases;if the subject consents; oras approved by the IRB in a research protocol.Note 1: If you receive a legal or governmental request to access identifiable, sensitive information connected to your research, do not release that information without contacting theCornell IRB officefirst.Note 2: If you want to\u2014or are required to\u2014share de-identified research data with other investigators, a CoC will not prevent you from doing so, as long as you ensure that the data you share do not contain any potentially identifying information. (mailto:irbhp@cornell.edu)\nif required by other Federal, State, or local laws, such as for reporting of communicable diseases;\nif the subject consents; or\nas approved by the IRB in a research protocol.Note 1: If you receive a legal or governmental request to access identifiable, sensitive information connected to your research, do not release that information without contacting theCornell IRB officefirst.Note 2: If you want to\u2014or are required to\u2014share de-identified research data with other investigators, a CoC will not prevent you from doing so, as long as you ensure that the data you share do not contain any potentially identifying information. (mailto:irbhp@cornell.edu)\nEnsure that anyone who is conducting research as a subawardee or receives a copy of identifiable, sensitive information understands they are they are also subject to the disclosure restrictions, even if they are not funded directly by NIH.\nInform study participants of the CoC and its protections and limitations during the informed consent process. The Cornell IRB has developed recommended language to be added to consent materials; please seeAppendix B.Note: If you already consented participants prior to learning that your study is covered under a CoC, NIH will not require that the researcher re-consent those participants. (#AppendixB)\nDocumentation for CoC for NIH funded Research:NIH will no longer issue a physical certificate.\u00a0 The Notice of Award and the NIH Grants Policy Statement serve as documentation of the CoC protection.\nCoC for research not funded by the NIH:Researchers seeking the protection of a CoC for research not funded by NIH mustsubmit an applicationto the NIH using theonline application system, or they may contact the CoC Coordinator for assistance atNIH-CoC-Coordinator@mail.nih.gov. (https://humansubjects.nih.gov/coc/apply, https://grants.nih.gov/policy/humansubjects/coc/how-to-apply.htm, mailto:NIH-CoC-Coordinator@mail.nih.gov)\nCoC for International Research:A CoC is deemed to be issued for relevant research, regardless of where the data is collected or housed; however, it is possible that such a certificate may not be effective for data held outside the U.S.\nCornell IRB procedures for CoC:In their review of new applications submitted to the IRB, IRB staff and reviewers will use the criteria outlined inAppendix Ato determine if the research is subject to a CoC. If it is, the IRB staff will inform the PI, and recommend the CoC related consent language to be added to the consent form if it is not there already. (#AppendixA)\n\nAppendices\nAppendix A: Determining Applicability of NIH CoC Policy\nQuestion 1: Was the research begun or ongoing on or after December 13, 2016?\u2610 Yes\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2610 No\nIf the answer is \u201cNo\u201d (i.e., the research was completed prior to 12/13/2016), the policy does not apply. If the answer is \u201cYes\u201d, answer the following questions.\nQuestion 2:\n2a. Is the research conducted or funded, in whole or in part, by NIH?\u2610 Yes\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2610 No\nIf the answer to the questions is \u201cNo\", then the policy does not apply, and the activity is not issued a CoC. If the answer is \u201cYes\u201d, answer the following questions:\nQuestion 3:\n3a. Does the research involve human subjects as defined by45 CFR Part 46?\u2610 Yes\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2610 No (https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/index.html)\n3b. Are you collecting or using biospecimens or information that are identifiable to an individual as part of the research?\u2610 Yes\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2610 No\n3c. If collecting or using biospecimens/information as part of the research, is there a small risk that some combination of the biospecimen/information, a request for the biospecimens/information, and other available data sources could be used to deduce the identity of an individual?\u2610 Yes\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2610 No\n3d. Does the research involve the generation of individual level, human genomic data?\u2610 Yes\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2610 No\nIf the answer to any one of these questions is \u201cYes\u201d, then the policy applies, and a CoC is automatically issued.\n\nAppendix B: Recommended Consent Form Language\nFor studies in which informed consent is obtained, NIH expects PIs toinform participants of the CoC and its protections and limitations via that informed consent process. The Cornell IRB has developed recommended language be added to consent materials:\nTo help us protect your privacy, this study is covered by a Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). With this Certificate, we cannot be forced (for example, by court order or subpoena) to disclose information that could identify you in any federal, state, local, civil, criminal, legislative, administrative, or other proceedings. In general, we cannot disclose information that could identify you to any other person who is not connected with this research, unless you give consent for that information to be disclosed. [If applicable:] The researchers will use the Certificate to resist any demands for information that would identify you, except to prevent serious harm to you or others. [If applicable:] A Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent the researcher from voluntarily disclosing information about you, without your consent, in incidents such as child abuse, or an intent to harm yourself or others. A Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent you, or a member of your family, from voluntarily releasing information about yourself or your involvement in this study.\nIf you have already consented participants prior to learning that your study is covered under a CoC, NIH does not require you to re-contact or re-consent those participants.\nAppendix C: Certificate of Confidentiality Resources\nNotice of Changes to NIH Policy for Issuing Certificates of Confidentiality (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-17-109.html)\nNIH Certificates of Confidentiality (CoC) Kiosk (https://grants.nih.gov/policy/humansubjects/coc.htm)\nNIH CoC FAQs (https://grants.nih.gov/faqs#/certificates-of-confidentiality.htm)\nNIH CoC Background Information (https://grants.nih.gov/policy/humansubjects/coc/what-is.htm)\nApplying for a CoC (for non-NIH-funded studies) (https://grants.nih.gov/policy/humansubjects/coc/how-to-apply.htm)\nIRB Guidance and Resources (/resources/irb-guidance-and-resources)\nInstitutional Review Board for Human Participant Research (IRB) Office (/offices/IRB)\nResearch with Human Participants (/compliance/human-research)\nQuick Reference\nRates (/rates)\nForms (/forms)\nPolicies (/policies)\nContacts (/contacts)\nTraining (/training)\nEvents (/events)\nNews & Announcements (/news)\n\u00a9 2019 Cornell University\nWeb Accessibility Help (mailto:rais-help@cornell.edu?subject=researchservices.cornell.edu%20site)"

Specifically, the Acts prohibit NASA from;\n\u2026using funding appropriated in the Acts to enter into or fund any grant or cooperative agreement of any kind to participate, collaborate, or coordinate bilaterally in any way with China or any Chinese owned company, at the prime recipient level or at any subrecipient level, whether the bilateral involvement is funded or performed under a no-exchange of funds arrangement.\nIn this context, \"China or Chinese-owned Company\" means the People's Republic of China (PRC), any company owned by the PRC, or any company incorporated under the laws of the PRC,including Chinese universities. The PRC includes Hong Kong and Macau, but not Taiwan (Republic of China).\nWhen a recipient of NASA funding, Cornell University is therefore restricted from collaborating with, either via a funded agreement or through a no-exchange of funds arrangement, China and/or Chinese-owned companies (as defined above) in the performance of the work funded by NASA unless approved by NASA. To ensure compliance with this restriction, NASA requires certifications from Cornell at proposal stage and includes implementing terms and conditions in each award.\nNASA\u2019s internal implementation instructions are codified in;\nProcurement Class Deviation (PCD) 12-01A, February 16, 2012\u2013 Applies to federal contracts and subcontracts (including funding from JPL). (https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/pcd/pcd12-01A.pdf)\nGrant Information Circular (GIC) 12-01A, September 26, 2012\u2013 Applies to Federal assistance agreements, both direct funded and received via subagreements (including funding from JPL). (https://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/grantnotices/gic12-01A.html)\nThere are limitations of NASA Restriction on Activity with the PRC;\nThe restriction currently does not apply to efforts funded by other federal and non-federal sponsors.\nOnly bilateral activities (i.e. two party agreements) are covered by the restriction. Multi-lateral agreements (i.e. agreements between three or more parties) are not subject to this restriction.\nAgreements for the purchase of non-commercial items of supply from China needed to perform a grant or cooperative agreement are excluded from this restriction. Additionally, agreements for commercial or non-developmental items (as defined by FAR 2.101) needed to perform contracts/subcontracts are exempt from this restriction. Therefore, vendor (i.e. procurement) agreements with PRC entities for commercial or non-developmental items are not subject to this restriction. (https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/48/2.101)\n\u201cGeneral scientific discussions\u201d do not constitute a bilateral policy, program, order, or contract and thus are permitted. However, these discussions must not involve discussions of bilateral collaboration between NASA and Chinese entities. See FAQ #8 located athttps://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs/prc-faq-roses/for additional information. (https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs/prc-faq-roses/)\nThe prohibition does not restrict individual involvement based on citizenship or nationality. Chinese citizenship is not considered an affiliation under these funding restrictions.Example: A Chinese student enrolled at Cornell on a visa would not have to be excluded from participation in a NASA-funded project unless they have a prohibited affiliation, with a Chinese institution.Example: An American citizen who has a faculty position at a Chinese university would have the kind of affiliation that would likely bar inclusion on a NASA-funded project.\nExample: A Chinese student enrolled at Cornell on a visa would not have to be excluded from participation in a NASA-funded project unless they have a prohibited affiliation, with a Chinese institution.\nExample: An American citizen who has a faculty position at a Chinese university would have the kind of affiliation that would likely bar inclusion on a NASA-funded project.\nDisclosure requirements to OSP\nTo ensure compliance with NASA\u2019s regulations, the Office of Sponsored Programs will require all named project personnel within a proposal (including faculty, researchers, staff, and students) to provide information regarding affiliations with China. Responses will be reviewed and further guidance provided to the researchers for follow-up actions as needed. Additionally, if any of the answers change at any time following proposal submission through close-out of an ensuing award, you are required to contact OSP to update the information.\nResearchers who are intending to apply for or have active NASA support and are pursing funding via theCornell China Centermust contactJamie Sprague, Sr. Grant & Contract Officer/Federal Team Lead, before accepting Cornell China Center funding. (https://chinacenter.cornell.edu/, /contact/jas2233)\nDisclosure Requirements to NASA\nThe NASA Guidebook for Proposers (dated February 4, 2021 and effective February 15, 2021)now requires applicants and awardees to disclose\u201call ongoing and pending projects and proposals (regardless of salary support) in which they are performing or will perform any part of the work. Co-Is proposing to spend 10% or more of their time in any given year to the proposed effort shall provide a list of ongoing and pending projects and proposals (regardless of salary support) that require more than 10% of their time in any given year. \u2026PIs and Co-PIs also shall list their current and pending support with Chinese universities and other similar institutions or a Chinese-owned company at the prime recipient level and at all subrecipient levels, whether the bilateral involvement is funded or performed under a no-exchange of funds arrangement.\u201d (https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/2021_ed._nasa_guidebook_for_proposers.pdf)\nNASA researchers are now required to disclose the following information within their Current & Pending document:\nFinancial Support. This includes sponsored awards held at Cornell, held at another institution/entity, or held as an individual that support an investigator\u2019s research efforts.\nIn-kind contributions. This includes non-monetary resources that are uniquely available to key personnel such as office/laboratory space, equipment, supplies, employees, students.\nChinese affiliations. This includes funded and unfunded support received from a Chinese entity whether such support is held at Cornell, held at another institution/entity, or held as an individual that support an investigator\u2019s research efforts.\nFor questions regarding NASA China restrictions and current and pending support, pleasecontact your assigned Grant & Contract Officer.

Do you have a financial relationship with a company or organization that is also funding your research, or might benefit from your research? The Financial Conflict of Interest Committee has developed guidance for you.\nAs stated in Principle 6 ofCornell Policy 1.7regarding Human Participant Research: (https://www.dfa.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/policy/vol1_7.pdf)\nProtecting the rights and welfare of human research participants is of the utmost importance and a requirement of all research personnel and the university. Of particular concern, therefore, are external commitments and financial interests that compromise or appear to compromise the rights and well-being of human research participants. The university scrutinizes the roles in such research of research personnel who have external commitments and financial interests with a sponsor or with an external entity that is related to, or can be affected by, the research.\nThe university has instituted a rebuttable presumption that research personnel who are involved in the design, participant selection, informed consent process, or the clinical management of a trial cannot have a financial interest in an entity whose interest could be affected by the research. In other words, the default position is that participation in human participant research by conflicted research personnel is not allowed. However, there may be compelling circumstances in which conflicted research personnel would be permitted to participate in the research. In these cases, the management strategies for the involvement of conflicted researchers must be carefully adjusted to the level of anticipated risk.\nA Conflict Management Plan, approved by the Financial Conflict of Interest Committee, with terms and conditions appropriate to the conflict, must be implemented to ensure the integrity of Cornell research, appropriate protections for students, and compliance with University policies. Information on management plans is availableonline. (/resources/how-conflicts-interest-are-reviewed-and-managed)\nConsistent with the principle stated above, the conflict management plan must also include additional protections for human participants. The CornellInstitutional Review Board (IRB), which is responsible for ensuring that the interests of research participants are protected, has the final authority in determining the conditions under which such research is allowable. Such research can be conducted with the restrictions listed below. In exceptional cases, theFCOI Committeeand the IRB may elect to waive some of these restrictions if they believe that these conditions will not be in the best interests of research, the institution and the human participants: (/resources/about-irb-committee, /resources/financial-conflicts-interest-committee)\nThe conflicted researcher may not serve as the PI for the research. Another individual who does not report to the researcher and does not have a financial interest in the company must serve as the PI.\nThe researcher may not be involved in the consenting, advising or data collection processes with participants.\nIn some instances, including clinical trials, the data may need to go through an independent review by a third party approved by the FCOI Committee.\nDuring the consenting process, participants must be informed of the researcher\u2019s relationship with the entity and, if appropriate, of the steps that are being taken to protect their interests and in the integrity of the research.\nThe Conflict Management Plan must be implemented before research personnel can participate in the design or conduct of the research, enrollment of participants, or analysis of the results.\nIf you have any questions, or want to discuss a particular scenario, please contact theCOI office.

If a project is appropriately budgeted and expended, the unexpended balance should not normally exceed 10%.\nUse\nFixed price agreements (grant, contract, cooperative agreement) are appropriate when they meet the following criteria:\nLegal contract is executed by both parties\nPayment is tied to specific milestones or deliverables that are clearly described in a statement of work\nWork will \u00a0be completed within a stated time frame and at \u00a0stated fixed price\nBudget is estimated prior to award and adhered to for the duration of the project with no required incremental funding (unless there is a negotiated change to the statement of work) unspent funds are retained by the University\nBudgeting\nProposals for fixed-price sponsored projects:\nMust be processed using established University procedures for sponsored projects regardless of any tentative understanding between the PI and the sponsor.\nRequire an itemized budget, whether required by the Sponsor or not, with costs estimated in a manner consistent with University cost accounting policies. The budget:Should not anticipate or plan for revenue in excess of anticipated budgeted costs.Should not include revenue to recover previously incurred expenses \u2013 whether related or not to the project.Should include appropriate F&A rates consistent with University policies\nShould not anticipate or plan for revenue in excess of anticipated budgeted costs.\nShould not include revenue to recover previously incurred expenses \u2013 whether related or not to the project.\nShould include appropriate F&A rates consistent with University policies\nCost Allocations\nMust not be incurred prior to full execution of the agreement, unless authorized by the award\nMust be directly related to the purpose and performance of the contract\nAt project completion account balance:May approximate zero if costs were accurately estimated orMay have a modest residual if there were unexpected but realized efficiencies.\nMay approximate zero if costs were accurately estimated or\nMay have a modest residual if there were unexpected but realized efficiencies.\nProcess\nUpon receipt of the proposal or award, the Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP) will review the proposal, budget, scope of work, and ensure the appropriate risk analysis is completed.\nIt is the responsibility of the PI to monitor the completion of deliverables, report on the results, and provide timely notification to the appropriate personnel in the Department, OSP and SFS in the event the University (i.e. PI, Department, College, and University) is unable to meet its obligations under the agreement.\nUpon project completion, the PI will notify their unit business officer that all deliverables have been accepted by Sponsor and the project is complete.\nIF THERE ARE COST OVERRUNS:PI will work with the business officer and SFS to document the overrun and agree on process to cover the shortfall.As with all shortfalls on sponsored projects, funds will normally be utilized in the following order:\u00a0 PI discretionary funds, Department funds, College fund\nPI will work with the business officer and SFS to document the overrun and agree on process to cover the shortfall.As with all shortfalls on sponsored projects, funds will normally be utilized in the following order:\u00a0 PI discretionary funds, Department funds, College fund\nIF THERE ARE RESIDUAL FUNDS:Business officer will notify SFS on behalf of the PI, requesting allocation of the funds in accordance with the following principles:If the project has received a reduction or waiver from the published F&A rate, SFS will charge the full F&A costs to the project before any final balance is determined.\nBusiness officer will notify SFS on behalf of the PI, requesting allocation of the funds in accordance with the following principles:\nIf the project has received a reduction or waiver from the published F&A rate, SFS will charge the full F&A costs to the project before any final balance is determined.\nAfter a final balance is determined, and all sponsor payments from the sponsor have been received, distribution will be as described in the table below.\nDistribution:\nEntire amount transferred to PI discretionary account.\n33% of balance remaining to PI discretionary account\n67% of balance remaining to Department\n\nRequires SFS review\nPI must submit written explanation of the reason for the high residual. The justification will be part of financial documentation subject to audit\n10% of balance remaining to PI discretionary account\n20% to Department\nRemainder to the College/School\n* In all cases, 100% of the residual balance will be returned to PI when it is equal to or less than $2,500, regardless of the percentage of total funding.\n\nExamples:\n$100,000 award, full F&A (note: full F&A rate will be charged before distribution)\n\n$100,000 award, reduced F&A of $10,000, restored F&A allocated to College\n\n$15,000 award, full F&A (note: full F&A rate will be charged before distribution\n\nNotes:\nAll work and the related expenditures on a fixed price project must occur before the end date of the award.\nNo-cost extensions are appropriate if necessary to meet deliverables or to complete the scope of work.\u00a0 They are not appropriate if the extension is requested solely for the purpose of spending the remaining funds.\nExcessive residual funding may be the result of projects costs not being appropriately charged or projected costs not being appropriately estimated. These instances may be subject to audit by SFS.\nIn the event of a disallowance of project costs following the transfer of residual funds, all distributions will be reversed.

As a result, many federal funding agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), are revisiting what information they require from investigators to appropriately assess other sources of support. A summary of NIH\u2019s efforts to address foreign influence concerns can be found at their webpageProtecting U.S. Biomedical Intellectual Innovation. As part of this effort, NIH issued Policy Notice NOT-OD-19-114,Reminders of NIH Policies on Other Support and on Policies related to Financial Conflicts of Interest and Foreign Componentsand the accompanyingFAQsin July 2019. This clarifying guidance from NIH outlines requirements that differ from what was previously understood to be required of applicants and awardees. A summary of these current NIH requirements follows. (https://grants.nih.gov/policy/protecting-innovation.htm, https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-19-114.html, https://grants.nih.gov/grants/faq-other-support-foreign-components.htm)\nDisclosure of Other Support\nNIH policy now requires applicants and awardees to disclose \u201call resources made available to a researcher in support of and/or related to all of their research endeavors, regardless of whether or not they have monetary value and regardless of whether they are based at the institution the researcher identifies for the current grant.\u201d With this clarification, NIH researchers are now required to disclose other support as follows;\nPositions, Appointments, and Affiliations.Any position or scientific appointment held by investigators that is relevant to the application must be disclosedincluding domestic or foreign, paid or unpaid, or full/part-time/voluntary. Titled academic, professional, or institutional appointments, including adjunct, visiting, or honorary must be disclosed. Outside activities that are not research related (e.g. serving on a science advisory board for a start-up company where the investigator will not perform research) do not need to be included in the disclosure, but may still require disclosure to Cornell in the annual financial conflict of interest (fCOI) disclosure.\nFinancial Support.This includes sponsored awards held at Cornell, held at another institution/entity, or held as an individual that support an investigator\u2019s research efforts. This also includes start-up packages from entities other than Cornell, and institutional awards at Cornell or other institutions that are separately budgeted and accounted for. Investigators do not need to disclose Cornell start-up packages, gifts, or endowed chairs, nor do NIH training grants need to be disclosed.\nNon-Financial Resources.This includes non-monetary resources that are uniquely available to key personnel such as office or laboratory space, equipment, supplies, employees, scientific materials, and selection to a foreign \u201ctalents\u201d or similar-type program. Non-financial resources that are available to the Cornell community at large, such as core facilities or shared equipment, do not need to be reported. Non-financial resources that are provided by entities other than Cornell are of particular interest to NIH, and investigators should take care to ensure that all necessary disclosures are made.\nNIH policy remains consistent regarding location and timing of such disclosures;\nAll other support and affiliations must be reported at Just-in-Time (JIT) stage via the Other Support document.\nApplicants are responsible for promptly notifying NIH of any substantive changes to previously submitted JIT information up to the time of award. Please contact your Grant & Contract Officer in the Office of Sponsored Programs for assistance.\nOther support obtained after the initial NIH award period must be disclosed in the annual research performance progress report (RPPR).\nIt should be noted that NIH has not yet updated theOther Support templateto reflect these clarified requirements. Investigators and administrators should modify the current template as needed to ensure compliance with the expanded disclosure requirements, including the reporting of total award amount for any financial support. (https://grants.nih.gov/sites/default/files/competing_othersupport.docx)\nForeign Component\nNIH requires applicants and recipients to determine whether project activities include a foreign component, defined as the existence of any \u201csignificant scientific element or segment of a project\u201d outside of the United States. In other words;\nPerformance of work by a researcher or recipient in a foreign location, whether or not NIH grant funds are expended and/or\nPerformance of work by a researcher in a foreign location employed or paid for by a foreign organization, whether or not NIH grant funds are expended.\nApplicants and recipients should first identify whether a portion of a project will be conducted outside of the U.S. before determining whether such activities are considered significant. Significance should be measured by the investigator within the context of the project as a whole. Examples of a foreign component include collaborations with investigators at a foreign site anticipated to result in co-authorship, the use of facilities or instrumentation at a foreign site, and the receipt of financial support or resources from a foreign entity. Foreign vendors (i.e. relationships that result in a procurement agreement) do not constitute a foreign component.\nForeign components must be disclosed in a proposal as aForeign Justificationattached to theR&R Other Project Information Form. The addition of a foreign component to an awarded project requires NIH\u2019s prior approval. (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/how-to-apply-application-guide/forms-e/general/g.220-r&r-other-project-information-form.htm#6, https://grants.nih.gov/grants/how-to-apply-application-guide/forms-e/general/g.220-r&r-other-project-information-form.htm)\nAdditional information regarding federal agencies\u2019 responses to foreign influence can be found on Cornell Research Services webpageDisclosing International Partnerships to Cornell and External Sponsorsand in the video recording of the November 2019 OSP Roundtable,Disclosing Foreign Relationships and Activities. Additionally, a letter to Cornell researchers from the Vice President for Research and Innovation,\u00a0and the Vice Provost for International Affairs regarding foreign influence can be found on Cornell Research Services webpageGuidelines for the Cornell University Faculty on Academic Integrity and Undue Foreign Influence.

As a result, many federal funding agencies, including the National Science Foundation (NSF), are revisiting what information they require from investigators to appropriately assess other sources of support. As part of this effort, NSF included updated requirements in the annual release of theProposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG), expected to be implemented effective June 1, 2020. This clarifying guidance from NSF outlines requirements that differ from what was previously understood to be required of applicants and awardees. A summary of these current NSF requirements follows. (https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappg20_1/index.jsp)\nA summary of NSF\u2019s current requirements as of June 2021 is available in theNSF Pre-award and Post-award Disclosures Relating to the Biographical Sketch and Current and Pending Supporttable on the NSF site. (https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/disclosures_table/june2021.pdf)\nDisclosing Current & Pending Support\nNSF policy now requires applicants and awardees to disclose \u201call resources made available to an individual in support of and/or related to all of his/her research efforts, regardless of whether or not they have monetary value.Current and pending support also includes in-kind contributions (such as office/laboratory space, equipment, supplies, employees, students). In-kind contributions not intended for use on the project/proposal being proposed also must be reported.Current and pending support information must be provided for this project, for ongoing projects, and for any proposals currently under consideration from whatever source, irrespective of whether such support is provided through the proposing organization or is provided directly to the individual.\u201d\nWith this clarification, NSF researchers are now required to disclose within their Current & Pending document as follows;\nFinancial Support.This includes sponsored awards held at Cornell, held at another institution/entity, or held as an individual that support an investigator\u2019s research efforts. This also includes start-up packages from entities other than Cornell. Investigators do not need to disclose Cornell start-up packages or gifts.\nIn-kind contributions.This includes non-monetary resources that are uniquely available to key personnel such as office/laboratory space, equipment, supplies, employees, students. The location of the disclosure of in-kind contributions within the proposal depends upon whether there is a time commitment associated and if the contribution is to be used for the proposal being submitted (see chart below). Such disclosures do not need to be replicated across proposal documents.\nNSF policy remains consistent regarding location and timing of such disclosures, and all current and pending support must be reported within the proposal.\nAdditionally, concurrent with the implementation of the updated PAPPG on June 1, 2020, all Current & Pending documents must be submitted through the use of anNSF-approved format, namelySciENcvand aNSF fillable PDF. (https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/cps.jsp, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sciencv/, https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/nsfapprovedformats/cps.pdf)\nPost-award Disclosure of Current Support and In-Kind Contribution Information (https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/fedrtc/agencyspecifics/nsf_1020.pdf)\nEffective October 5, 2020, the National Science Foundation (NSF) standard terms and conditions establishes a post-award disclosure requirement for undisclosed current support and in-kind contribution information. Therefore, as of this date if Cornell discovers that a PI or Co-PI on an active NSF award failed to disclose current support or in-kind contributions within their proposal, OSP must submit a notice to NSF informing them of the undisclosed support or contribution within 30 days of identification of the oversight by Cornell. NSF will review the disclosure and, after possible consultation with OSP, determine the impact of the new information on the award and, where necessary, take appropriate action.\nResearchers and research administrators are encouraged to review submitted current and pending documents to ensure that all required disclosures have been made. In the event current support or in-kind contributions not previously disclosed to NSF are identified, please notify your assigned Grant & Contract Officer as soon as possible.\nBiographical Sketch\nWith the release of the PAPPG effective June 1, 2020, NSF researchers are now required to disclose within their Biographical Sketch as follows;\nPositions, Appointments, and Affiliations.All academic, professional, or institutional appointment held by investigators whether current or previously held must be disclosed including domestic or foreign, paid or unpaid, or full/part-time/voluntary. Titled academic, professional, or institutional appointments, including adjunct, visiting, or honorary must be disclosed.\nThese clarified requirements extend the scope of required reporting beyond that which is attributable to an investigator\u2019s affiliation with Cornell. Investigators must complete and update their Biographical Sketch based on the totality of their positions, appointments, and affiliations, both within and outside of Cornell.\nConcurrent with the implementation of the updated PAPPG on June 1, 2020, all Current & Pending documents must be submitted through the use of aNSF-approved format, namelySciENcvand aNSF fillable PDF. (https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/biosketch.jsp, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sciencv/, https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/nsfapprovedformats/biosketch.pdf)\nInternational Partnerships\nWithin each proposal, applicants are required to mark intended partnerships with international collaborators on the NSF Cover Page under three circumstances;\nInternational Activities:Each proposal that describes an international activity, defined as research, training, and/or education carried out in cooperation with international counterparts either overseas or in the U.S. using virtual technologies, must list the country(ies) with which project participants will engage on the NSF Cover Page.\nFunding of an International Branch Campus of a U.S. Institution of Higher Education (IHE):Each application that proposes to fund an international branch campus of a U.S. university (e.g. Weill Qatar) must check the International Activities Country Name(s) box and enter the name of the applicable country(ies) on the NSF Cover Page.\nFunding of a Foreign Organization:Each application that proposes to fund a foreign organization, including through use of a subaward or consultant arrangement, must check the Funding of a Foreign Organization box and enter the name of the applicable country(ies) on the NSF Cover Page.\nFor questions regarding NSF current and pending support, biographical sketches, and foreign partnerships, please contact your assignedGrant & Contract Officer.

As a result, there are several actions that faculty need to take to ensure that all required disclosures are made and avoid exposing their projects, themselves, and the University to risk.\nWhat do I need to do?\nDisclose All Sources of Support:All current and pending support of your research endeavors,whether this effort is though Cornell, through an outside entity, or a personal venture, must be disclosed to external research sponsors as required by their guidelines and regulations. This includes both foreign and domestic sources of support. SeeDisclosing International Partnerships to Cornell and External Sponsors. Researchers who hold support that is not managed by Cornell cannot rely solely on research administrators to complete their current and pending support reports. Research administrators will not have access to this information through Cornell systems. (/policies/disclosing-international-partnerships-cornell-and-external-sponsors)\nDisclose All Appointments and Affiliations:All academic professional, or institutional appointments held by investigators must be disclosed in applications for external funding. This includes those that are domestic or foreign, paid or unpaid, or full/part-time/voluntary (including adjunct, visiting or honorary). SeeDisclosing International Partnerships to Cornell and External Sponsors. (/policies/disclosing-international-partnerships-cornell-and-external-sponsors)\nDisclosure of Consulting Activity:All time spent working for or consulting with foreign entities or institutions must be reported to the university in your Financial Conflict of Interest disclosure regardless of whether such activity is conducted in your professional or personal capacity, and whether such effort is paid or unpaid. SeeDisclosing International Partnerships to Cornell and External Sponsors. If this activity is in support of and/or related to your research efforts, it must also be disclosed under your current and pending support in your proposals to federal agencies. (/policies/disclosing-international-partnerships-cornell-and-external-sponsors)\nForeign Collaborations in Sponsored Projects:Collaboration with a foreign entity (e.g. subawards, consultants, funded or unfunded collaborations with investigators located at a foreign site, etc.) in a project must be disclosed in funding applications and project reports. Additionally, adding a foreign collaboration to an existing award may require prior approval from the sponsor. SeeDisclosing International Partnerships to Cornell and External Sponsors. (/policies/disclosing-international-partnerships-cornell-and-external-sponsors)\nForeign Travel:Observe the appropriate security precautions when traveling. Register your travel in the Cornelltravel registryand follow theinternational travel guidelines from Cornell\u2019s CIT. SeeTravel and International ActivitiesandExport Controls and International Travel. (https://navigate.cornell.edu/hc/en-us/articles/115006777427-Travel-Registry, https://travelregistry.cornell.edu/, https://it.cornell.edu/security-and-policy-students-travelsecure/travel-internationally-technology, /manage/travel, /resources/export-controls-and-international-travel)\nNegotiating Unfunded Research Collaborations with Foreign Entities:All unfunded collaboration agreements and non-sponsored revenue-generating agreements must be initiated by yourunit's contract administratorand include standard language to protect academic freedom, intellectual property, and non-discrimination. SeeExploring an Academic Collaboration. (https://global.cornell.edu/operations/collaborations/international-contracting, https://global.cornell.edu/operations/collaborations/exploring-academic-collaboration)\nReporting Foreign Gifts and Contracts:Cornell University is committed to complying with reporting requirements for foreign gifts and contracts, as outlined in Section 117 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 and in Section 207-a of the New York State Education Law. SeeReporting Foreign Gifts and Contracts. (https://www.dfa.cornell.edu/our-policies/reporting-foreign-gifts)\nScreen and Monitor Visitors:Working with foreign collaborators on Cornell University grounds is often vital and productive to the research enterprise. If you are bringing a visitor to campus, whether a fellow scientist, student, or funder, make sure that you have properly vetted them and provide adequate supervision. SeeExport Controls in Research and Education \u2013 Visiting Scholars. (/resources/export-controls-research-and-education)\nWho Can Answer my Questions?\nFor externally sponsored research projects, OSP oversees international collaborations and funding.

It may require institutional approval;\u00a0may be regulated at the federal or state level;\u00a0or may require specialized infrastructure or controls.\nWork Requiring Institutional Committee or Office Approval\nFor research with animals, human participants, r/sNA, certain biological materials, and radiation, institutional approval will be required before funding can be released; in some cases, approval will be required even sooner (e.g., \"Just in Time\" requests). In general, we recommend you start work on your compliance protocolsat the proposal stage:\nIACUC protocol(live vertebrate animals) (/resources/submit-new-iacuc-protocol)\nIRB protocol(humans) (/resources/submit-or-manage-your-irb-protocol)\nIBC MUA(r/sNA or biohazards) (/resources/ibc-application-submission-review-and-approval)\nRadiation Safety approval (/compliance/research-safety)\nIf you are seeking NIH funding for amulti-site human participant research study, your project may require a Single IRB (\"sIRB\") Plan. Contact theIRB officewell in advance of submitting your proposal to discuss. (/resources/multi-site-and-collaborative-irb-research, /offices/IRB)\nSpecific Requirements for Hazardous Materials and Equipment\nThe purchase and use of certain types of materials and equipment may be regulated at the federal or state level or may necessitate specialized monitoring equipment, infrastructure, or controls. It is important to identify these requirements and the associated time and financial costs early in the planning process so they can be properly budgeted for and prevent a delay in starting your project.\nExamples include:\nRecombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules\nBiological agents classified as Risk Group 2, 3, and 4\nSelect agents and toxins\nRadioactive materials and radiation producing equipment\nClass 3B and 4 lasers\nMagnets\nControlled substances\nToxic and flammable gases\nChemicals with special storage or handling requirements (i.e. pyrophoric)\nEquipment with special ventilation requirements\nGet Help\nThe contacts and webpages listed here can provide you with guidance on the compliance and safety-related aspects of your proposed research:\nIACUC office;homepage for animal work (/offices/iacuc, /compliance/live-vertebrate-animal-research)\nIRB office;homepage for human research (/offices/IRB, /compliance/human-research)\nIBC office;homepage for work with r/sNA or biohazards (/offices/ibc, /compliance/rsna-or-biohazardous-research)\nEHS Research Safety office;homepage for research safety (mailto:askEHS@cornell.edu, /compliance/research-safety)\nDeadlines/Scheduling\nSome funding agencies, such as the DOE, require the completion of an environmental compliance questionnaire as part of the grant application process. Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) will assist with the completion of these questionnaires. Because some questionnaires are lengthy and complex, please allow five (5) days for completion.

(SeeUniform Guidance Appendix III Section C.7 below) (#UG_AppIIIC.7)\nF&A Rate Usage Guidelines\nProposals for new and competing renewal awards should use the latest set of rates in effect, while proposals for non-competing continuations (e.g., annual NIH continuations) should use the fixed rates that were in effect and frozen at the time of the initial award(per UG below). In this context, \"competing\" refers to the amount of time originally proposed. For example, a five-year award will be subject to the rate schedule in effect at the time of the award, even when the funds are released annually. However, an award that has additional time added (excluding No Cost Extensions) will be subject to the then-current rates on the extended period. For both Endowed and Contract Colleges, F&A costs are calculated on modified total direct costs (MTDC), which equals the total direct costs less the following exclusions: (#UG_AppIIIC.7)\nCapital equipment items with a unit cost of $5,000 or more and a useful life of more than one year. ($500,000 threshold for computer software)\nCost in excess of $25,000 on each subcontract (F&A costs are charged on the first $25,000 of each subcontract).\nGRA exclusion (amount of GRA support equivalent to tuition and fees including\u00a0Graduate Health Insurance).\nLeases of real property.\nParticipant support costsfor conferences, seminars and certain training programs.

As reported bymedia outlets, bythe NIH, andin scientific journals, the impact is more acute for some sectors of the research community than others. (https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/06/science/covid-universities-women.html, https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2020/07/28/an-early-look-at-applications-submitted-during-the-pandemic/, https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0921-y)\nThe broad goal of REFRESH is to provide resources to help\nfacilitate a return to faculty research activities\npromote the long-term success of our research faculty\nensure that those researchers who have been most severely disadvantaged by the COVID-19 pandemic receive the support they need to resume research activities.\nTo help achieve these goals, REFRESH focuses on supporting external grant funding activities. We will do this in several ways by\nidentifying the unique and changing needs of each researcher through a \u201cNeeds Survey\u201d\nfunding grant writing support for eligible individuals\ndeveloping mentoring networks and improving interactions across different colleges\nproviding resources for dependent care support\nresponding to ongoing needs as they arise.\nSubmit an Application (https://cornell.infoready4.com/#competitionDetail/1849822)\nThe REFRESH application process helps us identify the needs of individual faculty as well as highlight common issues experienced by specific groups of faculty. Additionally, the process helps us connect individual researchers to the appropriate support that they need to re-energize their research. A major goal of REFRESH is to identify the additional needs of our researchers.\nPlease consider submitting an application even if you don\u2019t immediately need help. This will help us identify and develop new programs in the future.\nThe REFRESH team will hold these responses in the strictest confidence.\nIn completing an application, you\u2019ll be asked a few easy-to-answer questions about the following:\nHow COVID has impacted your research success.\nWhether you need some specific types of support, including the following:Grant writing support (monetary or mentoring)Mentoring or networking\u2014finding the right connections on campusDependent care\nGrant writing support (monetary or mentoring)\nMentoring or networking\u2014finding the right connections on campus\nDependent care\nOnce you have submitted your application it will be reviewed by the REFRESH team and a decision will be emailed to you within a month of your application submission. For those requesting networking or mentoring assistance, you will be matched with relevant campus programs or specific individuals. See below for more information for those seeking dependent care support.\nGrant Writing Support\nFunding for grant writing help is available and everyone is eligible to apply.\u00a0Please email the REFRESH team for further information atrefresh@cornell.edu.

Travel on these awards must comply with Cornell's policy as well as the NYS travel manual. (https://www.osc.state.ny.us/agencies/travel/manual.pdf)\nAll Cornell University business travel is subject toUniversity Policy 3.2, Travel Expenses. University business travel funded by a sponsored award may have additional or more specific requirements, as defined by sponsor rules. In all cases, Cornell University travel must comply with the more restrictive of these requirements. (https://www.dfa.cornell.edu/policy/policies/travel-expenses)\nThis page outlines major differences between the University Policy 3.2, Travel Expenses, and the NYS travel manual. Remember that the latter applies only where the award specifically invokes the NYS travel manual. If you have any questions regarding the NYS travel requirements pleasecontact us. (mailto:mailto:sfs-help@cornell.edu)\nTravel Status\nNYS rules define travel status as being at least 35 miles away from both one\u2019s home and one\u2019s regular work site. If circumstances do not meet this definition, the traveler is considered to be traveling in the proximity of the regular worksite.\nWhen one is traveling in the proximity of the worksite,normally neither meals nor lodging are reimbursed. Mileage cost is reimbursable, using either the distance between the traveler\u2019s home and the alternate worksite or the traveler\u2019s normal worksite and the alternate worksite, whichever is less.\nOvernight Travel\nCornell\u2019s policies do not authorize the use of per diem for lodging, nor the payment of lodging costs when no cost was incurred (e.g., staying with friends or relatives). Therefore,you may not use the NYS \u201cUnreceipted Method\u201d (Method 1). All overnight travel must use the \u201cReceipted Method\u201d (Method 2), although receipts are not required in some cases.\nReceipts are required for lodging, and reimbursable costs under NYS rules are limited to thefederal per diem ratesfor the travel region, exclusive of taxes. The balance of the lodging costs must be charged to non-sponsored funds. (https://www.gsa.gov/travel/plan-book/per-diem-rates/per-diem-rates-lookup)\nReceipts are not required for meals, which are reimbursed at thefederal per diem ratesfor the travel region. However, NYS divides the federal per diem rates differently, and does not consider lunch as reimbursable. The table below shows the breakdown of the per diem. (https://www.gsa.gov/travel/plan-book/per-diem-rates/per-diem-rates-lookup)\nPer diem for incidentals may be claimed for all overnight travel. All per diems on the first and last day of travel are subject to reduction in accordance with university policy.\n\n\nExample:\nCurrent per diem rates for Buffalo are $104 for lodging, and $64 for meals and incidentals.\nMaximum lodging charge is $104 plus tax per night, and a fixed allowance of $5 for incidentals and $59 for meals is provided.\nWhere per diem is adjusted, for provided meals or other reasons, breakfast is valued at $11, and dinner at $43.\nForeign travel uses a similar practice of lodging capped at the federal rate, provision of the incidental expenses of the per diem and the allocation of the meal per diem with 20% for breakfast and 80% for dinner.\nSame Day Travel\nBreakfast may be claimedwith receiptsup to the applicable federal per diem, apportioned using the NYS method above,if travel begins at least one hour before normal workday.\nDinner may be claimedwith receiptsup to the applicable federal per diem, apportioned using the NYS method above,if travel ends at least two hours after normal workday.\nWithout receipts, the limit is$5 for breakfastand$12 for dinner.\nAs with overnight travel, no claim may be made for lunch, as the state considers this to be a personal expense.\nTravel and International Activities (/manage/travel)\nTravel Safety and Emergency Planning for Employees Abroad (/resources/travel-safety-and-emergency-planning-employees-abroad)\nKeep Data and Devices Safe when Traveling (/resources/keep-data-and-devices-safe-when-traveling)\nQuick Reference\nRates (/rates)\nForms (/forms)\nPolicies (/policies)\nContacts (/contacts)\nTraining (/training)\nEvents (/events)\nNews & Announcements (/news)\n\u00a9 2019 Cornell University\nWeb Accessibility Help (mailto:rais-help@cornell.edu?subject=researchservices.cornell.edu%20site)"

Learn more about Cornell's IRB and its membership.\nThe Cornell IRB is a standingcommittee of the University Facultywhose activities are overseen by the Vice President for Research and Innovation. \u00a0Cornell's Human Research Protection Program operates under two Federal Wide Assurances (FWAs) filed with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services: one for the Ithaca-based campuses, including Cornell Tech (\"Cornell University\"), and one for Weill Cornell in New York City. Cornell University's FWA is FWA00004513. Weill Cornell operatesseparate IRBs. (/policies/irb-policy-irb-charge, https://research.weill.cornell.edu/compliance/human-subjects-research/institutional-review-board)\nWhat does the IRB do?\nThe IRB is responsible for providing guidance and oversight for Cornell's Human Research Protection Program, and for helping to maintain compliance with applicable regulations and policies.\nFederal regulations require that any IRB include at a minimum: one member whose primary concerns are in scientific areas, one member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas, numerous members representing more than a single profession, and at least one individual not affiliated with Cornell.\nBecause Cornell is a large institution, additional members are included to provide adequate representation of the diverse research community and to accommodate the workload associated with reviewing large numbers of applications. Membership beyond the minimum required by regulation is drawn from faculty and staff primarily from the social, behavioral, and biological sciences.\nCornell's IRB includes twelve to eighteen voting members. Members are appointed by the President, upon recommendation of the Dean of Faculty in consultation with the Vice President for Research and Innovation. Members are typically appointed to a three-year term. The committee chair is appointed from the faculty membership and will serve for a term of one to three years, after which they may be re-appointed.\nWhen does the IRB meet?\nThe IRB generally meets on the first Friday of every month.

The following considerations are those that investigators will frequently encounter when preparing a proposal. YourGrant and Contract Officer (GCO)can provide additional guidance with other questions or concerns that may arise. (http://theuniversityfaculty.cornell.edu/the-new-faculty-handbook/6-policies-and-assistance/6-2-research/, /gco)\nTypes of Proposals\nA proposal is a request for support of sponsored research, instruction, or extension projects, and generally consists of a cover page, brief project summary, technical or narrative section, biographical sketches of the key personnel, and a detailed budget. Common proposal types include:\nSolicited proposals, submitted in response to a specific solicitation issued by a sponsor. Such solicitations, typically called Request for Proposals (RFP), or Request for Quotations (RFQ), are usually specific in their requirements regarding format and technical content, and may stipulate certain award terms and conditions (seeProposal Preparation and Processing Responsibilities). Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs) are not considered formal solicitations. (/resources/proposal-preparation-and-processing-responsibilities)\nUnsolicitedproposals, submitted to a sponsor that has not issued a specific solicitation but is believed by the investigator to have an interest in the subject.\nPreproposals, requested when a sponsor wishes to minimize an applicant's effort in preparing a full proposal. Preproposals are usually in the form of a letter of intent or brief abstract. After the preproposal is reviewed, the sponsor notifies the investigator if a full proposal is warranted.\nContinuation or Non-Competing proposals,confirm the original proposal and funding requirements of a multi-year project for which the sponsor has already provided funding for an initial period (normally one year). Continued support is usually contingent on satisfactory work progress and the availability of funds.\nRenewal or competing proposals, are requests for continued support for an existing project that is about to terminate, and, from the sponsor's viewpoint, generally have the same status as an unsolicited proposal.\nAppropriateness\n\"In 1989 the Cornell Faculty Council of Representatives adopted a resolution endorsing the right of faculty to pursue research of their choosing, as long as that research: is within the guidelines of scholarly quality; is accessible to all interested scholars; and is in compliance with the laws of the land.\" More specifically, only proposals to sponsors whose terms and conditions allow freedom of access and publication are acceptable to Cornell. The University does not permit government classified research, research projects that do not permit the free and open publication, presentation, or discussion of the results, nor the exclusion of hiring foreign nationals.\nConsortiums/Joint/Collaborative Proposals\nProposals for research to be conducted by Cornell and one or more other parties as a joint venture or partnership will occasionally raise questions concerning the legal relationship and liability of each party. When such questions arise OSP will review the arrangement and/or special concerns with University Counsel, unless the arrangements are clearly intended to establish a traditional contractor-subcontractor, consortium, or joint study relationship.\nA consortium arrangement exists when two or more organizations agree to participate in a collaborative project. It is not necessary for a consortium to be a formal or legal agreement. One participant will be designated as the lead institution at the time of proposal submission and accepts full funding and responsibility from the sponsor. Subcontracts are then used to transfer part of the work and appropriate funds to the other participant(s). All conditions imposed by the sponsor on Cornell are also imposed on the subcontractor(s).\nWhen Cornell is the lead institution OSP requires a statement from each participating organization that includes a full cost budget and work scope, and is signed by an authorized representative.Your GCOcan provide you with further details. (/gco)\nConsultants\nConsultants and subcontractors are independent contractors and not employees or agents of the University. Special review and approval procedures are required if a project anticipates using consultants. Designation of independent contractor status is governed by the Internal Revenue's Code of Common Law. Cornell may be subjected to significant institutional tax penalties should the individual be incorrectly classified as an independent contractor. In addition, contracting with an independent contractor may expose the University to significant financial risk if the consultant has limited net worth or inadequate insurance coverage.\nA consultant should not be confused with a subcontractor. Both are different in their activity and relationship to the Statement of Work (SOW). A consultant guides, aides, or provides other technical or professional service to the principal investigator. While a consultant may impact the results of the SOW, they do not conduct work resulting in the satisfaction of a portion of the SOW. A subcontractor conducts a part of the SOW and is responsible for the outcome of that work.\nQuestions concerning the use or status of an independent contractor should be directed toyour GCOwell in advance of the proposal deadline. (/gco)\nMore information on Consultants and Subcontractors can be found in theBudget and Costing Guide. (/resources/overview-costs-project-budgets-budget-and-costing-guide)\nContracts\nAt the time of proposal submission a sponsor will often require an indication of what terms and conditions will be acceptable to Cornell in the event of an award. Exceptions to a sponsor's terms and conditions are addressed by the GCO in a transmittal letter. For commercial sponsors OSP will often include a copy of the standard Cornell agreement. Investigators who are aware of special sponsor requirements should discuss them with their GCO well in advance of the proposal deadline.\nCornell will normally only enter into agreements that adhere to the following principles: the research is conducted on a best efforts basis without guarantee of success and without financial risk or liability to the University; costs are fully reimbursed unless cost-sharing has been approved; and, there are no restrictions on the dissemination of the research results except: 1) those that relate to the protection of a sponsor's proprietary information; 2) the rights of privacy of individuals; or 3) establishing rights in patentable inventions and other intellectual property.\nIntellectual Property\nIntellectual property is addressed in the terms and conditions negotiated by OSP when accepting an award. For most awards Cornell will retain ownership of intellectual property developed on sponsored projects in order to avoid conflicting commitments to various sponsors. In the case of patents, policy requires the University to retain ownership unless a special waiver is approved by the Vice Provost for Research. Sponsor rights are protected through appropriate licensing arrangements.\nAs with patents, Cornell prefers to retain ownership of copyrights. In some instances Cornell will allow the sponsor to own the copyright on deliverable reports, while retaining the right of use for University purposes.\nContactCornell's Center for Technology Licensingfor more information. Additional information can be foundHERE. (/offices/ctl, /commercialize)\nPrincipal Investigator (PI) Responsibility\nThe principal investigator or project director is responsible for the conduct of the research or other activity being supported by a sponsored project. Responsibility includes the technical direction of the work and other contractual obligations such as reporting, proper cost assignment, and supervision of project personnel and subcontractors. Additional information can be found on theProposal Preparation and Processing Responsibilitiespage. (/resources/proposal-preparation-and-processing-responsibilities)\nInformation on who can serve as a PI can be foundHERE. (/policies/pi-eligibility)\nProposal Components\nFormat and Content\nSponsors frequently revise proposal guidelines and other requirements (e.g., page limits, font sizes, margins, number of copies). Guidelines can vary not only among sponsors, but also among programs within an agency. Questions concerning proposal requirements that are not addressed in the sponsor's guidelines can usually be answered by the appropriate GCO inCALS,CVM, orOSP. In general, both government and non-government sponsors require the following: (/offices/cals-office-sponsored-research, /offices/cvm-cro, /gco)\nCover or title page:This should include the title of the proposed project, name(s) and title(s) of the principal investigator and co-investigators (if any), proposed project period, dollar amount, sponsor, the date, and any required College or department signatures. As the legal entity submitting the proposal on behalf of the investigator, Cornell University, with OSP's address, should be used for the institutional address.\nIntroduction:A brief description of the proposed project's objectives, any direct or closely related work which may be in progress, and any other pertinent background information as required by the sponsor.\nTable of contentsor index with page references.\nDetailed program description, including an explanation of the objectives in clear and concise terms, and a description of the procedures to be followed in carrying out the objectives.\nDescription ofcurrent facilities and equipment, and the percentage of time they will be available for the proposed project.\nList of personnel:Include the names and titles of all professional personnel. Since named personnel might be used within key personnel clauses in an agreement, nonprofessional personnel should be listed by title or function only.\nCurriculum vit\u00e6of key personnel: Include only professional and academic essentials and avoid personal background information.\nList of principal investigator'spublications: Include only those that are relevant or significant to the proposed project. The list should not include items such as publications being printed, or invited lectures.\nBudget with justificationsand supporting documentation, where appropriate. See the\"Budget and Costing Guide\"for guidance and sample templates found in the appendices. (/resources/overview-costs-project-budgets-budget-and-costing-guide)\nConcurrent submission:When the same proposal is being submitted to other sponsors a statement should appear in each proposal indicating that it is a concurrent submission.\nList of key personnel'scurrent or pending supportshould include:the source of support;project title;percent effort;dates of project period;annual costs; andhow this project does not overlap or duplicate projects supported by other funds. The statement \"No overlap\" is considered insufficient by most sponsors.\nthe source of support;\nproject title;\npercent effort;\ndates of project period;\nannual costs; and\nhow this project does not overlap or duplicate projects supported by other funds. The statement \"No overlap\" is considered insufficient by most sponsors.\nIf required, includeletters of collaboration, subcontractor proposals, and other supporting documentation.\nSpecial requests or justifications:These could include: a change of principal investigator on renewal or continuation proposals, use of unexpended funds from a prior budget period, or the temporary absence of the principal investigator.\nCertifications and representationsand other forms that may be required. These should be prepared by the department for signature by OSP.\n\nUnexpended Funds\nFor continuation or renewal proposals most sponsors require an estimate of unexpended funds and reserve the right to approve the use of those funds for future budget periods. This should be discussed with your GCO well in advance of a resubmission to determine whether a carry forward request or a no-cost extension is more appropriate.\nProposal Development, Review, and Submission (/proposal/develop)\nRegister for Federal and Non-Federal Systems (/resources/register-federal-and-non-federal-systems)\nPre-Award Research Operations (PRO) (/resources/pro-research-operations)\nFind My GCO (Grant & Contract Officer) (/gco)\nSample Proposal Library (/resources/sample-proposal-library)\nProposal Review Guidelines (/resources/proposal-review-guidelines)\nLimited Submissions Funding Opportunities (/resources/limited-submissions-funding-opportunities)\nPI Eligibility (/policies/pi-eligibility)\nInstitutional Profile, DUNS, and UEI Numbers (/resources/institutional-profile-duns-and-uei-numbers)\nRASS (Form 10 is Phased Out) (/forms/rass-form-10-phased-out)\nNFA (Non-Financial Agreements) (/forms/nfa-non-financial-agreements)\nQuick Reference\nRates (/rates)\nForms (/forms)\nPolicies (/policies)\nContacts (/contacts)\nTraining (/training)\nEvents (/events)\nNews & Announcements (/news)\n\u00a9 2019 Cornell University\nWeb Accessibility Help (mailto:rais-help@cornell.edu?subject=researchservices.cornell.edu%20site)"

In this section, the Principal Investigator (PI) provides additional detail for expenses within each budget category and articulates the need for the items/expenses listed. The information provided in the budget justification may be the definitive criteria used by sponsor review panels and administrative officials when determining the amount of funding to be awarded.\nThe following format is a sample only; not all components will apply to every proposal. Many sponsors prefer that budget justifications follow their own format. In all cases, however, it is best to present the justification for each budget category in the same order as that provided in the budget itself.\nSalaries and Wages:\nNote: The quantification ofunfundedeffort (e.g., \"The PI will donate 5% effort...\") in the proposal narrative, budget, or budget justification is considered Voluntary Committed Cost Sharing. This is a legal commitment which must be documented in the University's accounting system. Consider quantifying effortonlyfor the requested salary support. Seehttp://www.dfa.cornell.edu/treasurer/policyoffice/policies/volumes/academic/costsharing.cfmfor additional information. (http://www.dfa.cornell.edu/treasurer/policyoffice/policies/volumes/academic/costsharing.cfm)\nPrincipal Investigator:This proposal requests salary support for _______% of effort during the academic year and 100% of effort for _______months during the summer.\nOther Professional Support:List title and level of effort to be proposed to be funded. Other personnel categories (Research Associates, Postdoctoral Associates, Technicians) may be included here.\nAdministrative and Clerical:List the circumstances for requiring direct charging of these services, which must be readily and specifically identifiable to the project with a high degree of accuracy. Provide a brief description of actual job responsibilities, the proposed title, and the level of effort. (See note at the end of this Appendix regarding direct charging costs that are normally considered indirect.)\nGraduate Students:List number and a brief description of project role. Include stipend, GRA allowance (tuition), and health insurance.\nUndergraduate Students:List number and a brief description of project role.\nEmployee Benefits have been proposed at a rate of ______% for all non-student compensation as approved by the Department of Health and Human Services. Seehttps://www.dfa.cornell.edu/capitalassets/cost/employee. (https://www.dfa.cornell.edu/capitalassets/cost/employee)\nCapital Equipment:The following equipment will be necessary for the completion of the project: Include item description(s), estimated cost of each item, and total cost. Provide a brief statement on necessity and suitability.\nTravel:For each trip, list destination, duration, purpose, relationship to the project, and total cost. Indicate any plans for foreign travel.\nTechnical Supplies and Materials:Include type of supplies, per unit price, quantity, and cost. When the cost is substantial, provide a brief statement justifying the necessity.\nPublications:Page charges (number of pages multiplied by the per-page charge).\nServices:Include type of services, cost per type, and total cost.\nConsultants: Include the consultant's name, rate, number of days, total cost per consultant, and total consultant cost. Provide a brief statement outlining each individual's expertise and justifying the anticipated need for consultant services. Note: Justifying a specific consultant in the proposal may avoid the need to competitively bid consulting services.\nSubcontracts:Include the subcontractor's name, amount, and total cost. Provide a brief description of the work to be performed and the basis for selection of the subcontractor. A separate budget and corresponding budget justification should be completed by the subcontractor, and is required by many agencies. Note: Justifying a specific subcontractor in the proposal may avoid the need to competitively bid subcontracted services. Post-award changes to subcontracts (additions, deletions, scope or budget modification) may require sponsor approval.\nOther Expenses:May include conferences and seminars (seeAppendix D), Repair and Maintenance, Academic and User Fees. (/resources/appendix-d-sample-budget-conferences-and-seminars)\nFacilities and Administrative Costs (F&A): F&A costs have been proposed at a rate of _____% of Modified Total Direct Cost (MTDC) as approved in Cornell's rate agreement with the Department of Health and Human Services. A copy of this agreement may be found athttps://www.dfa.cornell.edu/capitalassets/cost/facilities. MTDC exclusions include Capital Equipment, GRA Allowance and Health Insurance, and Subcontract costs in excess of $25,000 per subcontract. (https://www.dfa.cornell.edu/capitalassets/cost/facilities)\nAnnual escalations are proposed in accordance with University policy as outlinedHERE. (/rates/escalation-rates)\nSpecial information for direct charging costs that are normally considered indirect.Many costs such as administrative and clerical salaries, office supplies, monthly telephone and network charges, general purpose equipment, and postage are not typically considered direct costs. These may be proposed as direct costs where \"unlike and different\" circumstances exist. In such cases a budget justification detailing the request must be submitted to OSP for review and approval.

When animal use is necessary, we maintain the highest ethical standards for their use and care.\nAdvancing Human and Animal Health through the Safe, Humane, and Judicious Use of Animals\nCornell University regards the study of animals in teaching and research as essential to continued progress in science, medicine, agriculture, and education. When animal use is necessary, we maintain the highest ethical standards for their use and care.\nStudies with animals conducted at Cornell University focus on agriculture, environmental sciences, biomedical engineering, veterinary medicine, life sciences, and psychology, including basic biology and behavior. The knowledge that scientists gain from studies involving research animals contributes to improving and saving the lives of humans and animals and brings advances in the diagnosis and treatment of major diseases and disorders \u2014 from cancer, heart disease, and diabetes to birth defects and neurological disorders. Cornell scientists do not conduct cosmetics testing.\nCornell scientists recognize the seriousness of using animals in pursuit of scientific discovery. Researchers carefully consider all alternatives, but the current state of basic biological knowledge often still requires scientists to rely on living systems for credible results. The vast majority of research animals are bred solely for this purpose.\nThe health and behavioral well-being of animals used in teaching and research is guaranteed by an interlocking set of state and federal laws and guidelines to which Cornell complies. In addition, Cornell meets the strict standards required to maintain accreditation of its animal care and use program. Cornell University'sInstitutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)\u2014 on which two members not affiliated with the university are drawn from the Ithaca community \u2014 reviews, approves, and monitors animal teaching and research to ensure compliance with these regulations. Cornell\u2019sOffice of Research Integrity and Assurance (ORIA)provides further oversight of Cornell\u2019s compliance with university policies and external regulations. (/offices/institutional-animal-care-and-use-iacuc-office, /offices/office-research-integrity-and-assurance-oria)\nCornell\u2019s staff of veterinarians, technologists, facilities management, and husbandry, all part of theCenter for Animal Resources and Education (CARE) at Cornell University, are specially trained to provide the clinical care, enrichment, and housing that assures the health and well-being of animals. They also assist Cornell scientists in meeting their legal and ethical responsibility for providing the most humane care possible. The Cornell staff has a passion for caring for animals and a professional and personal commitment to ensuring that Cornell\u2019s animals receive high quality compassionate care. (/offices/center-animal-resources-and-education-care)\nCenter for Animal Resources and Education (CARE) at Cornell University\nTheCenter for Animal Resources and Education (CARE) at Cornell Universityis part of the Vice President for Research and Innovation\u00a0office. Headed by the official university veterinarian \u2014 the attending veterinarian \u2014CAREis a group of veterinarians, veterinary technologists, facility managers, and support staff responsible for the welfare of animals used in teaching and research at Cornell. The director ofCAREis board certified by theAmerican College of Laboratory Animal Medicine (ACLAM)\u2014 a specialty recognized by theAmerican Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA).\u00a0This certification indicates the completion of specialized training in the care and use of animals in teaching and science. In addition to the director, allCAREstaff veterinarians are board-certified by theAmerican College of Laboratory Animal Medicine (ACLAM)as well. Other staff have various degrees and professional certifications, and all have received extensive training and experience in the field. (/offices/center-animal-resources-and-education-care, /offices/center-animal-resources-and-education-care, /offices/center-animal-resources-and-education-care, https://www.aclam.org/, https://www.avma.org/Pages/home.aspx, /offices/center-animal-resources-and-education-care, https://www.aclam.org/)\nPromoting Human and Animal Health through Animal Research\nAdvancing the health and welfare of people and animals is central to the mission of Cornell\u2019s research. Only a small portion of Cornell research involves animals. Such research is part of a range of approaches necessary to make progress in medical treatments and techniques for humans \u2014 and animals. The study of animals has led, in part, to advances in medical diagnosis, treatment, cures, and devices that have saved and improved millions of human lives worldwide.\nThese advances include chemotherapy, insulin, organ transplants, bypass surgery, modern prosthetic limbs, immunizations, and drugs to treat or moderate the effects of diseases, such as HIV, Alzheimer\u2019s, high blood pressure, and malaria.\nExamples of current studies at Cornell involve zebra fish and mice: Zebra fish make it possible for scientists to image and monitor single synaptic connections and neurons in the living brain. Current studies focus on control of movement and the question of why sleep is fundamental not only to human life but to every animal with a nervous system. How can a tiny fish shed such light on these complex subjects? Zebra fish eggs and larvae are transparent, so their development, including the brain, can be monitored regularly and non-invasively in the live fish, using fluorescent imaging techniques.\nAnew model for studying ovarian cancer, the fifth leading cause of death in women, is being developed by investigating the disease in mice \u2014 how healthy stem cells in the female reproductive system and other locations become cancerous. The studies look at how the cells are formed, where they come from, which are more susceptible to transformation, and why. Scientists compare the behavior of the disease in mice to what happens in human cells. They have also been able to develop organoids, which are organ-like structures created to replicate what happens in a living organism. These organoids are an example of a non-whole animal tool developed to study certain aspects of disease, thus reducing animal use. (https://research.cornell.edu/news-features/womens-silent-killer-ovarian-cancer)\nCornell researchers also study many diseases affecting animals such, asFeline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP), gastro-intestinalcorona viruses, and a number of parasites, including lung worms andhemophilia in dogs, so individuals and veterinarians can provide better care for animals. (https://www.vet.cornell.edu/departments-centers-and-institutes/cornell-feline-health-center/health-information/feline-health-topics/feline-infectious-peritonitis, https://ahdc.vet.cornell.edu/news/equine_enteric_coronavirus.cfm, https://ahdc.vet.cornell.edu/sects/coag/clinical/Hemopha.cfm)\nAssuring Humane Care\nInstitutions using animals for teaching and research must establish and maintain standards and safeguards to protect the health and well-being of the animals. Institutions failing to do so will risk losing federal, state, and private research grants. Beyond regulations and proscriptions detailed in federal laws and policies such as the Animal Welfare Act and the Public Health Service Policy on Human Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, Cornell is committed to treating animal teaching and research subjects with care and dignity. Cornell has a stringent set of closely monitored policies and practices to that end.\nCornell requires scientists who conduct animal research to adhere to standards and practices delineated in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Research Council. The Guide, written by a collaboration of research scientists, veterinarians, and laypersons representing the public\u2019s interest in animal welfare, includes dos and don\u2019ts of veterinary care (surgery, analgesics, anesthesia, and euthanasia methods), housing conditions (food, water, sanitization, temperature, humidity, lighting, and drainage), and a physical environment that promotes psychological wellbeing (exercise, enrichment of the enclosure, and companionship). Similarly, the care of agricultural animals is detailed in the Guide for the Care and Use of Agricultural Animals in Research and Teaching published by the Federation of Animal Science Societies.\nInspectors from the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) conduct announced and unannounced inspections at least once a year to assure compliance.\nCornell also voluntarily participates in a rigorous peer review evaluation conducted byAAALAC International, an independent non-profit organization that is dedicated to enhancing the quality of research, teaching, and testing by promoting humane, responsible animal care and use around the world. Every three years AAALAC site visitors review each area where animals are housed or used at Cornell as well as all related records. In its latest reevaluation, in June 2021, AAALAC reaccredited Cornell\u2019s program of animal care and use. (http://www.aaalac.org/)\nProtocols for Animal Use\nBefore any animals can be acquired for use in teaching and research at Cornell, the lead researcher (principal investigator) must submit a detailed scientific justification and description of their use and care as part of a formal protocol review to the Cornell UniversityIACUC. (/offices/institutional-animal-care-and-use-iacuc-office)\nThis protocol describes all animal work from the outset of a proposed experiment to its conclusion. An important part of the review is implementation of the \u201c3 Rs\u201d:REPLACEthe use of animals with alternatives when possible;REDUCEthe number of animals used to a minimum by obtaining information from fewer animals or more information from the same number of animals; andREFINEthe way procedures are carried out and animals are housed, for example to minimize pain and/or improve animal welfare.\nThe protocol must be approved by theIACUCbefore work with animals can begin and is required by peer-reviewed professional journals for publication of research results. (/offices/institutional-animal-care-and-use-iacuc-office)\nTheIACUCensures that personnel conducting procedures on animals are appropriately qualified and trained. All individuals named on a protocol must undergo training before they can use animals. The core training includes ethical principles and requirements for practicing humane care. Individuals also undergo additional species- and procedure-specific training provided by the CARE veterinary staff. (/offices/institutional-animal-care-and-use-iacuc-office)\nAll Cornell faculty members, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduates, and research personnel involved in the care and use of animals in teaching and research as well as department heads where such work takes place are required to familiarize themselves with and to followCornell Policy 1.4 Care and Use of Live Vertebrate Animals in Research and Teaching. (https://policy.cornell.edu/policy-library/care-and-use-live-vertebrate-animals-research-and-teaching)\nTheIACUCoversees Cornell University\u2019s animal program, facilities, and procedures. Its members include the attending veterinarian, Cornell\u2019s biosafety officer, animal facility managers, faculty members, and individuals from the community with no affiliation with Cornell University. In addition to the review and approval of all animal use protocols, the IACUC conducts semi-annual inspections of all spaces where animals are housed or used. The IACUC has the authority to stop an experiment at any time if the health and welfare of an animal may be at risk. (/offices/institutional-animal-care-and-use-iacuc-office)\nVeterinarians and veterinary technicians from CARE visit animal facilities daily. CARE veterinarians have specialized training and experience in the clinical care of animals used in science and teaching. They advise researchers on the most humane way to practice analgesia, anesthesia, and surgery. They are available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week as needed, to examine and treat animals when necessary. As an added safeguard, animal husbandry technicians, who care for the animals every day, are trained by CARE veterinarians to spot any signs of injury, ill health, or abnormal behavior and to alert a member of the CARE veterinary staff immediately if they notice any irregularity.\nORIA provides oversight of Cornell\u2019s research programs to ensure that they are compliant with applicable university policy and regulatory requirements. ORIA staff educate the research community regarding research integrity and university and government requirements for conducting research at Cornell. They provide services such as ethics refresher training, protocol review to ensure congruency with the humane treatment standards set forth in Cornell policy and regulations, and post-approval quality assurance reviews \u2014 to educate researchers about requirements and best practices and to proactively mitigate potential compliance risks.\nCornell provides means to anonymously report concerns about animal care and use and instances of suspected non-compliance with laws and regulations and protects its facility employees, committee members, researchers, and laboratory personnel from retaliation from good-faith reports of concerns.\nWhich Species?\nRodents (mice and rats) account for the majority of animals used for teaching and research. Other species may include guinea pigs, rabbits, nontraditional rodents (e.g. voles and giant African pouched rats), cats, dogs, swine, dairy and beef cattle, sheep, horses, poultry, and various aquatic, amphibian and avian species.\nThe Versatile Mouse and Zebra Fish\nSmall, easy to care for, and a prolific breeder, the mouse is a versatile research subject. For example, mice become elderly in one to two years, making them perfect for studies on the aging process. Further, transgenic mice (those with a non-native gene) offer unprecedented insights into ways that individual genes function. Scientists can turn off specific genes or parts of genes (in what they call a knock-out mouse) or enhance the function of a gene (in a knock-in mouse), then watch for changes.\nIn the field of cancer, Cornell scientists are using such mice to study blood and lung cancers, a leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. One aspect of this research is to study whether manipulating certain genes can halt lung cancer progression and sensitize lung cancer to chemotherapy. Some studies involving transgenic mice focused on diseases such as tuberculosis and the influenza virus. Others investigate cognitive processes such as social recognition and memory. Additional studies attempt to broaden basic understanding of metabolic processes such as the secretion of insulin and the processing of vitamins and nutrients, while other research aims to perfect tests that can safeguard the public from tainted food and drinking water.\nWhy are mice so valued as laboratory animals? Scientists theorize that shortly before dinosaurs became extinct about 75 million years ago, mice, rats, and humans inherited genes from a common mammalian ancestor. Around 90 percent of the estimated 25,000 to 30,000 genes in a rodent have counterparts in humans, making rodents ideal models for studying human disorders. Researchers know that Alzheimer\u2019s and other neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis attack neurons, cells that communicate between the body and the brain, but they don\u2019t know why. Different genetic strains of mice vary in their sensitivity to these diseases, so the role of genetics in these diseases can be studied. Biomedical engineers utilize mouse model systems to study aging-related declines in organ healing, including skeletal muscle, liver, and blood-producing tissues. Advances in studying mice have provided an alternative to using other species for many disease models.\nAs an alternative to the use of mammalian species, zebra fish provide many cell biological and development processes similar to those in mammals and are, therefore, replacing the use of mammals at a growing pace. Zebra fish embryos and larvae are completely transparent, so it is easy to observe and monitor their development with non-invasive techniques. New methods of introducing genetic material and manipulating the genome\u2014when combined with the ability to easily observe the results\u2014have allowed researchers to create models for multiple types of cancer, muscular dystrophy, tissue regeneration, and many other human diseases and treatments. The increasing use of the zebra fish demonstrates researchers\u2019 attempts to step away from many traditional mammalian species, while continuing to push the boundaries of our scientific knowledge.\nHow Many Animals? As Few As Possible\nWhen animals are involved, every effort is made to keep their numbers as low as possible without jeopardizing scientific validity. In order to conduct an animal study, the investigator must first show that animals are absolutely necessary and that there are no alternatives for obtaining the relevant information. They must provide scientific justification for the number of animals needed for a study. The IACUC ultimately decides if the justification is sound and the number of animals necessary for a study. When research involves animals, valid and reliable results depend on superior animal care, which incurs an expense, a further factor in ensuring diligence in keeping animals numbers as low as possible.\nFrequently Asked Questions About Animal Studies at Cornell University\nQ: Why can\u2019t computer models replace animals in teaching and researching?A:Computer models, use of in vitro (test tube, petri dish, etc.) methods, and virtual reality devices are some of the approaches used whenever possible as alternatives to studying live animals. Computer models can be built using what is already known about biological processes, however, living organisms are far more complex than any model available today. The activity of many thousands of proteins or the interaction between the circulatory system, liver, brain, and nervous system, for example, needs to be thoroughly understood before a computer simulation can be built. Although use of alternatives complements the study of animals, and reduces the numbers used, the only way scientists can fully study a disease and treatment is in a living organism.\nQ: Are lost or stolen pets used as laboratory animals?A:No. All animals used in teaching and research are acquired legally, following detailed regulations. With the exception of a small number of donated (usually agricultural animals such as horses) and wild-caught animals, all of the research and teaching animals are bred solely for that purpose and acquired through licensed vendors.\nQ: What types of animals are commonly used?A:Mice are, by far, the most commonly used animals.\nQ: Don\u2019t most laboratory animals live a life of pain and suffering?A:No. The use of animals in teaching and research is highly regulated, particularly with regards to pain alleviation. Most animals never undergo painful procedures. For the few procedures that do involve discomfort or pain, appropriate pain medications are administered. There are rare cases where the nature of a study makes it impossible for momentary pain or discomfort to be completely avoided, for example, just as with humans, the level of pain and discomfort from a disease or following surgery is kept as low and short as possible, although cannot always be eliminated.\nQ: What happens to the animals when experiments are completed?A:All transgenic animals (those to whom a non-native gene has been introduced) are humanely euthanized. Other animals may also be humanely euthanized as part of the research to examine tissue, for example. Dairy cows involved in nutrition studies, or horses used for teaching demonstrations are returned to the dairy herd or put back in pasture. Most of the few dogs and cats are adopted, after spay or neutering.\nQ: Does anyone profit from the use of research animals at Cornell University?A:As an education and research institution, Cornell\u2019s mission is to share the results of its research for the public good. Cornell licenses its patented discoveries to businesses for commercial development and distribution or to nonprofit agencies and philanthropic foundations that assist Cornell in disseminating the invention for the greatest good. Proceeds, if any, go to the inventor, the university, and the relevant college under an established formula. Revenue from the licensing of intellectual property arising from animal research is modest and is generally used to fund further research.\nOrganizations That Safeguard the Welfare of Animals in Teaching and Research\nBelow is a list of organizations that are concerned with the humane care of animals:\nAAALAC International (http://www.aaalac.org/)\nAmerican Association for Laboratory Animal Science (AALAS) (http://www.aalas.org/index.aspx)\nAmerican College of Laboratory Animal Medicine (ACLAM) (http://www.aclam.org/)\nAmericans for Medical Progress (https://www.amprogress.org/)\nEuropean Society of Laboratory Animal Veterinarians (ESLAV) and the European College of Laboratory Animal Medicine (ECLAM) (http://eslav-eclam.org/)\nFoundation for Biomedical Research (FBR) (https://fbresearch.org/)\nInternational Association of Colleges of Laboratory Animal Medicine (IACLAM) (http://www.iaclam.org/)\nNational Association for Biomedical Research (NABR) (http://www.nabr.org/)\nQuick Reference\nRates (/rates)\nForms (/forms)\nPolicies (/policies)\nContacts (/contacts)\nTraining (/training)\nEvents (/events)\nNews & Announcements (/news)\n\u00a9 2019 Cornell University\nWeb Accessibility Help (mailto:rais-help@cornell.edu?subject=researchservices.cornell.edu%20site)"

If cumulative expenses exceed the variance, or if there are other restrictions with regard to rebudgeting, a written request through the OSP Grant and Contract Officer for the award needs to be submitted to the agency. The sponsor will be concerned about the scope of the project and whether goals can be met with the changes requested.\u00a0 Costs associated with the rebudgeting request should not be incurred on a project until written permission is granted. Formal changes to a project budget, through issuance of an amendment or modification, shall be reflected in the budget presented in the university's general ledger at the required level of detail.\nFederal awards issued under the terms of the Federal Demonstration Partnership, or more recently under theResearch Terms and Conditions, do not require agency approval of certain budget changes, as long as they do not constitute a change in scope. These types of budget changes are not recorded in the general ledger, and it is the PI and administering unit's shared responsibility to ensure that project spending is consistent with the scope of work and award authority. As a reminder, certain budgetary changes, for example NSF-funded participant costs, or alterations of space, requireprioragency approval. These line items will be reflected in the general ledger on a specific object code, account or sub-account. Further information may be found in the award, agency terms and conditions, the Research Terms and Conditions, or consult SFS.

OSP and COI staff work together to check reports and communicate with PIs and Department Liaisons to ensure all necessary reports have been submitted. OSP staff can submit a proposal once all required COI reports are filed, or an exception is approved by the COI office or the Vice President for Research and Innovation. (https://coiprod.hosting.cornell.edu/)\nBefore an award can be accepted, all real or apparent conflicts of interest for each person listed as PI, Co-PI or Key Personnel must be reviewed, and either managed or eliminated. OSP and COI staff work together to review award materials and COI reports, and identify any real or apparent conflicts that might be connected to the sponsored project. If such a conflict appears to exist, the COI office will work with the FCOI Committee and the conflicted individual to develop or update a conflict management plan (seeHow Conflicts of Interest are Reviewed and Managed). Once that plan has been approved by the Committee, the award can be released. Note: this can take a few weeks or more, depending on the nature of the relationship and the extent of the conflict. (/resources/how-are-conflicts-interest-reviewed-and-managed)\nPHS (including NIH) awards:If the award is from the NIH, or another agency of thePublic Health Service(PHS), there are additional regulatory requirements, including award-specific COI reporting, travel reporting, and training. OSP and COI staff work together to check required reporting and training; PHS awards cannot be released until these requirements are met. For more information, visitCOI Requirements for NIH (PHS) Funded Researchers. (http://thefdp.org/default/fcoi-clearinghouse/fcoi-agencies/, /resources/coi-requirements-nih-phs-funded-researchers)\nSubawards (incoming or outgoing):For most subawards (incoming or outgoing), there are no special COI-related requirements. The main exception to that rule is for subawards connected to funding from NIH or anotherPHS agency, as PHS policy requires that all recipients of their funding (including subaward recipients) comply with their policy; Cornell must confirm that each subawardee is compliant. If there are any questions or concerns related to a PHS-funded subaward, OSP or COI staff will contact the PI. (http://thefdp.org/default/fcoi-clearinghouse/fcoi-agencies/)\nSBIR/STTR awards:COI considerations for Small Business Innovation Research (\"SBIR\") or Small Business Technology Transfer (\"STTR\") awards to Cornell from private entities are no different from any other awards, except when a member of the Cornell team has a financial interest in the sponsoring entity. In that case, because the Cornell researcher has a financial interest in the company sponsoring the research, this intersection of interests presents a conflict of interest that must be managed under a management plan. For details, seeCOI Guidance for SBIR/STTR projects. (/resources/coi-guidance-sbirsttr-projects)\nCOI considerations when sponsored research involves Human Participants:VisitManaging COI For Research Involving Human Participantsto learn about requirements pertaining to potential conflicts of interest for this type of project. (/resources/managing-coi-research-involving-human-participants)\nCOI considerations for funding in the form of gifts:Research funding in the form of gifts to the university is subject to the same considerations for conflict of interest as sponsored funding. In particular, a COI may arise when the investigator whose research will benefit from the gift has a financial interest or another significant relationship with the donor.University policy 4.14describes some additional considerations for gifts. However, since gifts are not processed by the Office of Sponsored Programs, reviews of gifts for conflicts of interests are generally done at the unit level.

NDAs are also known as confidentiality agreements (CA), confidential disclosure agreements (CDA), proprietary information agreements (PIA), or secrecy agreements (SA). Examples of information covered by an NDA include confidential material, proprietary information, and\u00a0patentable ideas*among others.\n*Cornell Patentable ideas and technology may be shared only throughCornell\u2019s Center for Technology Licensing.If a Cornell employee wishes to receive confidential information and the proposed transaction complies with certain requirements, he or she may use theIndividual Standard Non-Disclosure Agreementwithout going through OSP. (/offices/ctl, /resources/standard-individualunilateral-non-disclosure-agreement-nda)\nWhen researchers wish to enter into an NDA and the conditions for use of the Individual Standard NDA are not met, they should contact the Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP) atosp_nda@cornell.edu.

transfers out of, as well as some transfers within, the U.S.\nExport Controls apply to U.S. citizens, anywhere in the world.\nExport Controls apply to everyone, regardless of citizenship, in the U.S.\nThe Fundamental Research Exclusion (FRE) is NOT available for physical shipments.\nTo claim the FRE, the research must not have publication,\u00a0dissemination, or participation\u00a0restrictions.\nTransfer of proprietary information to a foreign national in the U.S. may require an export license.\nAny activity with comprehensively sanctioned countries (currently Iran, Cuba, Syria, North Korea, Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus) must be approved by Cornell\u2019s Export Controls Office (ECO).\nPenalties for violations include substantial monetary fines (levied against the organization and the individual) and can include jail time in the case of willful violations.\nMyths:\n\u201cExport Controls do not apply to my shipment because it is non-hazardous.\u201d\n\u201cExport controls do not apply to my shipment because you can order it on Amazon.\u201d\n\u201cEverything is research related, so I do not need to be concerned about Export

Biological materials, such as reagents, cell lines, plasmids, and vectors, are the most frequently transferred materials, but MTAs may also be used for other types of materials, such as chemical compounds and even some types of software. This category also includes orders processed through material repositories such as Addgene, the non-profit plasmid repository.\nWhen investigators want to obtain material for their research from outside the University, they should contact the Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP) atosp_mta@cornell.edu. OSP is responsible for entering into agreements for incoming materials. (mailto:osp_mta@cornell.edu)\nOSP has signed a Master Reception Agreement with Addgene. This agreement covers all requests for materials from Addgene that fall under the standard Uniform Biological Material Transfer Agreement (UBMTA) terms. Because OSP has signed this master agreement, individual standard Addgene MTAs no longer need to be processed through OSP. Investigators may request material directly through the Addgene online system. When material is requested, investigators will be asked to acknowledge the terms of use and assert that applicable compliances are in place. Addgene will then distribute the material to the investigator. Addgene will inform OSP when materials have been requested but OSP will not administer or track the individual orders.\nIf/when investigators choose to make their materials available to others they should contact theCornell Center for Technology and Licensing(CTL) at(607) 254-4698. CTL is responsible for the licensing and use of Cornell intellectual property.

Please referenceOFAC\u2019s Sanctions Program and Country Information Pagefor the most current list of countries and restrictions. Please consult withCornell'sExport Control Officeprior to arranging travel to the following countries: (http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Pages/Programs.aspx, mailto: exportcontrols@cornell.edu, /contact/jmm793)\nUkraine\nCuba (Seehttps://global.cornell.edu/travel-cuba) (https://global.cornell.edu/travel-cuba)\nIran (See theIran Sanctions Guidance Document) (/policies/export-controls-iran-sanctions-guidance-document)\nNorth Korea\nSyria\nRussia\nBelarus\nThere are various lists which the federal government maintains with the restrictions and restricted entities.\u00a0OFAC\u2019s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List and the Commerce Department\u2019s Entity List are the most relevant.\nPlease consult withCornell's Export Control Officeto run Restricted Party Screening prior to travel. (/offices/export-controls-office)\nTravel Information and Policies\nCornell University utilizes a travel registry for Ithaca-based Cornellians to record travel plans:http://travelregistry.cornell.edu (http://travelregistry.cornell.edu/)\nCornell travelers can log complete itineraries online.\u00a0Travel registration is mandatory for all staff, faculty, undergraduate, and graduate students traveling internationally on behalf of Cornell.\u00a0In addition to notifying relevant departments about Cornell business related travel, this process allows each registrant to be eligible for emergency evacuation services should they be required in the event of natural disasters, health emergencies or political unrest.\nCornell Travel Policies\nhttps://policy.cornell.edu/policy-library/risk-management-international-travel (https://www.dfa.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/vol8_5.pdf)\nhttps://policy.cornell.edu/policy-library/travel-expenses (https://www.dfa.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/vol3_2.pdf)\nTraveling with Encrypted Devices\nCornell owned laptop computers are routinely equipped with encryption software and are subject to export control regulations under the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). U.S. regulations may permit the export of such computers under certain export license exceptions, however various countries have implemented prohibitions against importing the same computers and software. Under United States law, no individual is permitted to export the encrypted software to a prohibited country or individual.\nAs mentioned above, certain countries, such as China, Israel, and Russia have restrictions on the import and use of encryption tools and do not allow cryptography tools to be imported or used within their borders without a license, or in some extreme cases, at all. Under these restrictions, any country can potentially confiscate systems mobile computing devices/ devices entering or leaving their borders. For that reason,Cornell strongly recommends traveling with loaner devices.\nOther Resources\nObtaining a Temporary Use Laptop (Loaner Device)\nIf your department does not have a spare device (loaner) on hand that can be used for travel, please contact your IT Department to see if they have any spare devices for you to use during travel.\nIf travel to one of these countries is a frequent or routine occurrence and/or loaner device isn't a viable option, the IT Security Office offers a service to work with your IT support provider on alternative solutions. For additional information, seehere. (https://it.cornell.edu/highrisktravel)\nU.S. Customs Device Inspections\nU.S. Customs officials are authorized to search or retain electronic devices to look for violation of export control regulations, as well as other laws and regulations.\nConsider taking a minimal device equipped with only ordinary, recognizable software and minimal data so your delay is minimal and the consequence of a loss less disruptive.\nExceptions\nTMP Exception (EAR \u00a7740.9)\nTMP Exception Letter (/sites/default/files/2023-12/TMP_Exception_Letter%2011-2023.docx)\nThe EAR makes an exception to licensing requirements for the temporary export or re-export of certain items, technology, or software for\u00a0professional\u00a0use as long as you meet the following criteria:\nThe item or software remains under the \"effective control\" of Cornell personnel while the property is abroad.Effective Controlmeans - retaining physical possession of an item or maintaining it in a secure environment such as a hotel safe or locked facility.\nThe item or software to return to the US within 12 months.\nThe item or software to be shipped, retransferred, or hand-carried be used ONLY as a \"tool of the trade\" to conduct Cornell University business.\nThe TMP exception does NOT apply to the following:\nAny EAR satellite or space-related equipment, components, or software, or to any technology associated with high-level encryption products.\nItems, technology, data, or software regulated by the Department of State\u2019s International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).\nItems going to Iran, Cuba, Syria, certain areas of Ukraine, or North Korea.\nElectronic Devices\nCornell owned electronic devices (the physical device and ordinary software installed on it) are typically subject to the EAR:\nLaptops, iPhones, Android devices\nMass market software such as Windows, OS X, Office, Adobe products, Visual Studio\nOpen source software such as Linux, Apache\nComplete, print and take with you, a copy of theTMP Exception Letterto self-certify your use of the exception.

(https://fdpclearinghouse.org/)\nCornell University is participating in a nationwide program to streamline the exchange of institutional information collected from potential subrecipient institutions. As a result of Cornell\u2019s participation in this program, the documentation required of potential subrecipient institutions included in Cornell proposals (Outgoing Subawards) and of Cornell when acting as a subrecipient on another institution\u2019s proposal (Incoming Subawards), have changed as described in detail below.\nDocumentation Requirements for Subrecipients Included in Cornell Proposals (Outgoing Subawards)\nAs of October 2016, institutions participating in this program are no longer required to complete theCornell OSP Subcontractor Commitment Formwhen proposing to participate in a Cornell project as a subrecipient. Instead, participating\u00a0institutions need only to provide project specific data (Subrecipient PI name, project period, total amount requested, cost share amount, authorized signature, compliances, etc.) via a Letter of Intent/Commitment (Sample LOI Template). A list of participating program organizations can be found at theFDP Expanded Clearinghouse Programwebsite. (/forms/subcontractor-commitment-form, /sites/default/files/2022-05/FDP%20ILCO%20%281%29.pdf, https://fdpclearinghouse.org/organizations)\nPotential subrecipient institutions who are not part of the program are still required to complete theCornell OSP Subcontractor Commitment Formwhen participating in projects funded by NSF, all PHS agencies, or any other sponsor who has adopted PHS regulations for Financial Conflict of Interest (FCOI). When participating in projects funded by all other sponsors, institutions who are not part of the program can elect to complete theCornell OSP Subcontractor Commitment FormOR provide project specific data via aLetter of Commitment. (/forms/subcontractor-commitment-form, /forms/subcontractor-commitment-form, /sites/default/files/2022-05/FDP%20ILCO%20%281%29.pdf)\n\nUse the decision tree below to determine the documentation required of each potential subrecipient.\nFDP Expanded Clearinghouse\u00a0Participant List (https://fdpclearinghouse.org/organizations)\n\nPlease contactTammy Wildenstein, Subaward Officer with questions or for additional information. (mailto:cu_subawards@cornell.edu)\nDocumentation Requirements when Cornell is a Subrecipient (Incoming Subawards)\nWhen participating as a subrecipient on a proposal submitted by a fellow participating\u00a0institution, the documentation expectations are reciprocal. Those preparing Cornell\u2019s subrecipient proposal should expect to provide the pass\u2010through sponsor the same level of documentation we would expect if the roles were reversed.

The purpose of these is to protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests from malign foreign actors who may wish to access our most advanced and useful technologies.\nQ: Isn\u2019t academia exempt from these rules?\nA: Not entirely. While there are some important \u201ccarve-outs\u201d from these rules for institutions of higher learning in the U.S. (seehere), export controls can and do apply to a variety of common activities occurring within the research enterprise at Cornell and elsewhere. (https://researchservices.cornell.edu/resources/export-controls-research-and-education)\nInternational shipping, travel to foreign locations, or even hosting foreign national visitors can all have potential export controls implications for you and Cornell.\nQ: What is the Fundamental Research Exclusion (FRE)?\nA: The FRE is one of the usefulcarve-outsafforded to academia with regards to export controls in the U.S. If your work qualifies as fundamental research (no barriers to publication or participation in the research efforts) then theresultsof such research are NOT subject to export controls requirements. (https://researchservices.cornell.edu/resources/export-controls-research-and-education)\nQ: What is Cornell\u2019s policy on fundamental research; can I do controlled or classified work here?\nA: Cornell Universityonlyconducts research that would fall under the FRE. Research projects that do not permit the free and open publication of results are not accepted at Cornell. Therefore no export-controlled or classified work may be conducted here. Refer toUniversity Policy 4.22. (https://policy.cornell.edu/policy-library/export-and-import-control-compliance)\nGreat effort is put into ensuring sponsored research at Cornell does not come with problematic clauses or restrictions that would negate the FRE \u2013 and thus subject the products of our research work to export controls.\nQ: Does the FRE cover the export of physical items?\nA: No, only non-tangible research results in the form of technology are excluded under the FRE. Physical items willalwaysremain subject to U.S. export controls. Depending on various factors a license may be required to physically export an item.\nQ:\u00a0 What should I do then if I have to ship something internationally as part of my Cornell duties/responsibilities?\nA:\u00a0 ALL international shipments sent from Cornell require review and approval from the Export Controls Office.\u00a0 Until further notice, this review is to be conducted via email (exportcontrols@cornell.edu).\u00a0 Seeherefor further details. (/resources/export-controls-procurement-and-shipping)\nQ: What if the physical item I need to ship was developed from a fundamental research project?\nA: The item would still be subject to export controls (and potential licensing) regardless of whether it was the result of fundamental research. As stated above, the FRE never exempts physical items from export control.Such shipments still require review and approval as noted above.\nQ: What if my fundamental research project involves proprietary background data (inputs) from the sponsor or another third party?\nA: While your research results will be exempt from export controls under the FRE, any proprietary data provided to you from outside of Cornell may be subject to export controls. All such transfers of data to Cornell need to be governed by a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) negotiated by theOffice of Sponsored Programs (OSP)with input from the Cornell University Export Controls Office (ECO). (https://researchservices.cornell.edu/offices/osp)\nQ: So, even though my international shipment is related to my research and is non-commercial, it\u2019s still an export?\nA: Correct; regardless of whether you\u2019re selling any items to the recipient overseas you are engaging in an export activity by sending something out of the U.S.\nQ: What about temporary shipments that come back to the U.S.?\nA: Temporary international shipments are still considered exports and must comply with all applicable regulations. There are however certain cases where a temporary export may not require an export license. The Export Controls Office will assist in making this determination.\nQ: Is hand-carrying an item during my travels considered an export?\nA: Yes, anytime you bring Cornell-owned items with you during international travel (whether in checked or carry-on luggage or on your person) you have just exported such items to your country of destination and any other countries you transited. Export controls regulations and licensing requirements apply equally to such hand-carried exports (although more exemptions may apply for travel than shipping).\nQ: Do I need an export license to carry a laptop to a foreign country?\nA: Many factors play into that but, for most standard-issued Cornell devices you would not require a license to most countries. However, if there is any proprietary technical data on the device, or if it contains software programs other than those normally installed by the manufacturer or Cornell IT (e.g. MS Office, etc.) than those may trigger the need for an export license. Additionally, the destination you travel could play a role in the determination process.\nReviewthis webpageor contact the Export Controls Office if any questions. (https://researchservices.cornell.edu/resources/export-controls-and-international-travel)\nQ: Are there certain countries that export controls makes off-limits?\nA: Yes, currently the following countries are subject to comprehensive trade embargoes and sanctions:\nCuba\nIran\nNorth Korea\nSyria\nUkraine\nRussia\nBelarus\nNearly all activities with or within these locations (including with universities in these locations) will require US government approval and must be discussed with the Export Controls Office first.\nDepending on the nature of your research there may be other country-specific restrictions or considerations to take into account.\nQ: Are there certain foreign companies, persons, or other universities that I cannot engage with?\nA: Yes, the U.S. government maintains various lists of so-called \u201cRestricted Parties\u201d. Such entities are either prohibited from being involved in export transactions generally, or are sanctioned to the extent that any interaction with them would be prohibited without a license.Contact the Export Controls Officefor screening of any foreign entities you may wish to collaborate or engage with. (https://researchservices.cornell.edu/offices/export-controls-office)\nAdditionally, there arecertain entitiesthat Cornell University will not allow collaboration with regardless of discipline or circumstances. (https://global.cornell.edu/sub/operations/international-engagement/engagement-china-faq)\nQ: What is an export license and how do I get one?\nA: An export license is specific authorization from the US government to engage in an export or sanctions activity that would otherwise be prohibited. These licenses must be obtained beforehand and are situation-specific (i.e. no \u201cblanket licenses\u201d can be obtained for your lab).\nAll export or sanctions licenses at Cornell University must be obtained via the Export Controls Office (ECO).\nQ: Who is considered a foreign national for the purposes of export controls?\nA: Any person who isnoteither:\nA U.S. Citizen,\nA U.S. Permanent Resident (i.e. a green card holder), or\nA person offered Protected Status under 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(3)\u2026\nis considered a foreign national for the purposes of exports controls regulations. Also, employees of foreign entities (including U.S. persons) are treated as foreign nationals no matter where located.\nQ: I have a foreign national visiting my lab; do I need an export license?\nA: Perhaps, this will depend on many factors. Generally-speaking having a foreign national visiting or working in your lab does not alone necessitate the need for an export license. There would need to be an actual release of export-controlled technology or software to the foreign national (i.e. a deemed export).\nIf you plan on sharing any information or software with them that is NOT already published and in the public domain, it is possible an export license could be required. Similarly, if you have export-controlled items in your lab and the foreign national requires direct access to them, it is possible a license is needed for that activity \u2013 further analysis by the Export Controls Office is necessary.\nAlso, keep in mind that if your visitor needs to take items from your lab back out of the country with them, this is an export that may require licensing.\nQ: My research isn\u2019t funded by the Department of Defense (DOD); do I really need to consider export controls?\nA: Yes, the source of funding is not always a proper gauge of whether or not your project could be affected by export controls regulations. There are DOD-funded projects for which export controls are not a factor and conversely, certain non DOD-funded projects are affected by export controls.\nQ: I\u2019ve been invited to speak at a conference in Iran. Are there any restrictions on this?\nA: Yes, there are prohibitions on providing services (such as lectures or speeches) while in Iran due to the sanctions on that nation. The Export Controls Office should be consulted immediately if you are invited to attend any event in Iran, or if you are considering similar activities in that country.\nExport Controls (/export-controls)\nDrusilla Jaiah - Export Control Associate (/contact/dbj43)\nJoi Mindingall - Research Security | Export Control Officer (/contact/jmm793)\nExport Control and Confidentiality Agreements (/resources/export-control-and-confidentiality-agreements)\nDetecting and Reporting Export Controls Violations (/policies/detecting-and-reporting-export-controls-violations)\nUkraine/Russia Transactions Guidance (/news/ukrainerussia-transactions-guidance)\nUniversity Policy 4.22, Export and Import Control Compliance (https://policy.cornell.edu/policy-library/export-and-import-control-compliance)\nOff-Campus Research (/resources/campus-research)\nImport Control (/resources/import-control)\nExport Control Quick Reference (/resources/export-control-quick-reference)\nExport Controls: Regulations and Overview (/policies/export-controls-regulations-and-overview)\nQuick Reference\nRates (/rates)\nForms (/forms)\nPolicies (/policies)\nContacts (/contacts)\nTraining (/training)\nEvents (/events)\nNews & Announcements (/news)\n\u00a9 2019 Cornell University\nWeb Accessibility Help (mailto:rais-help@cornell.edu?subject=researchservices.cornell.edu%20site)"

Export Compliance is the responsibility of all Cornell University faculty, staff, and students. Penalties for non-compliance\u00a0are severe and impact both the institution and the individual.\nExport Control Laws and Regulations\n\"Export Controls\" are federal laws and regulations that govern the transfer or disclosure of goods, technology, data, software, services, information, and funds (collectively \"Items\"). Export Control laws apply not only to transfers out of the country, but to some in-country transfers as well. They apply to all disclosures, including but not limited to electronic, visual, oral, and physical disclosures.\nInternational Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)Citation:22 CFR 120-130Agency: Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC), US Department of StateStatutory Authority: Arms Export Control Act (AECA)Scope: Primarily military itemsExamples of Items controlled: satellite technology, some unmanned aerial vehicles, global positioning systems, chemicals, night vision technology, navigation systems, sonar and radar systems, military electronics and software.

Nor will the university enter into any agreements unless the principal and co\u2010principal investigators have the final authority on what is to be published or presented.\u00a0In particular, research which is confidential to the sponsor or which is classified for security purposes is not permitted at Cornell University.\u00a0The university will accept only sponsored research projects which are expected to further the research and educational mission of the institution.\nFundamental Research\nCornell conducts only research that qualifies asfundamental research.This is defined as research in science, engineering, or mathematics, the results of which ordinarily are published and shared broadly within the research community, and for which the researchers have not accepted restrictions for proprietary or national security reasons. (EAR 734.8(c)).\nResearch will not be considered fundamental research if there are restrictions on the publication of scientific and technical information resulting from the project.\nResearch will not be considered fundamental research if Cornell has accepted any restrictions (such as foreign national participation), due to proprietary or national security reasons.\nITAR further limits fundamental research topublishedresearch conducted at institutions of higher learning in the U.S. (22 CFR \u00a7 120.34 (a)(8)).\nBona fide Employee Exemption (limited use for Cornell faculty)\nThe ITAR (U.S. 22 CFR \u00a7125.4 (b)(10)) and EAR (740.13(f)) authorizes the transfer of unclassified technical data by U.S. institutions of higher learning to foreign persons in the United States who are bona fide, full-time regular employees of that institution.\u00a0 Three criteria are required:\nThe employees\u2019 permanent abode throughout the period of employment be in the United States.\nThe employee CANNOT be listed as a national of a country listed in 126.1 of the ITAR or Country Group D:5 of the EAR.\nThe employee is notified in writing that the technology or technical data may not be transferred to other foreign persons with the prior written approval of the U.S. Government.\u00a0The obligation not to transfer technology extends\u00a0beyond the tenure of employment at the University.\nNote that certain end use and user restrictions still apply. The above exemptions cannot be utilized without prior written approval from the Export Control Office.\nPublication\nExport Controls do not apply to information that is already public, and the regulations contain exclusions for information that is \u201cpublicly available\u201d (EAR) or is in the \u201cpublic domain\u201d (ITAR).\nThe \u201cpublicly available\u201d exclusion under EAR includes a wide range of obvious categories, such as information that is available in a library, that has been published, or that is typically taught in for-credit courses.\nResearch on Campus\nExport control laws have the potential to substantially impact research at Cornell University. If research involves specified technologies, and it does not quality for the Fundamental Research Exclusion, the EAR and/or ITAR may require prior federal approval:\nBefore allowing foreign nationals to participate in the research.\nBefore partnering with a foreign company.\nBefore sharing research results in any manner (including by publication or presentation at conferences) with persons who are not U.S. persons.\nExport regulations apply whether or not the recipient is funded by a grant, contract, or other agreement,\u00a0and apply whether or not the EAR or ITAR are cited in the award document. If a researcher accepts export-controlled technology or technical data, the researcher is subject to ITAR or EAR regulations.\nPlease also seeOff Campus Research. (/resources/campus-research)\nMost Cornell research activities are excluded from export controls because of the exception known as\u00a0 the \u201cFundamental Research Exclusion\u201d under the export control regulations. By not accepting any restriction on publication or the appointment of foreign nationals to the research, Cornell protects the Fundamental Research Exclusion.\nVisiting Scholars\nForeign National Visitors to campus should be screened against the denied entity and SDN lists.\u00a0International Scholars and students visiting on J-1 VISAS as well as non-students and visiting faculty should be screened to\u00a0ensure that the individual or the affiliated institution is not included in any U.S. Government lists prohibiting access to certain materials and information on campus.\nAppropriate protections should be put in place to ensure that foreign visitors do not have access to restricted, controlled, or proprietary information or items.\nFaculty and staff should know who is in their labs\u00a0at all times. Records should be maintained noting the name and affiliation of all lab visitors, as well as the date(s) and purpose of the visit.\nForeign Collaborations\nIn general, collaborations between Cornell University faculty and scholars at foreign institutions or organizations do not require export licenses unless they involve export controlled or restricted research, or the research involves scholars in sanctioned countries. The University needs to determine if export licenses are required and to verify that the foreign individual and/or organization are not blocked or sanctioned\u00a0prior to engaging in an international collaboration.\nThe Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Controls (OFAC) administerseconomic sanctions programswhich should be reviewed prior to engagement. (https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Pages/Programs.aspx)\nFor additional guidance regarding working with China, seeEngagement with China: FAQ. (https://global.cornell.edu/resources/engagement-china-faq)\nSponsored Agreements\nThe Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP)\u00a0performs a thorough review of all proposals and agreements to assist in determining export control risks, and works to remove any language which is in direct conflict with the University\u2019s performance of Fundamental Research.\nIn addition, OSP performs Restricted Party Screenings on the entities being contracted with, prior to release of award.\nDuring the proposal and agreement review process, OSP looks for:\nReference to U.S. export regulations\nRestrictions on\u00a0non-U.S. citizen\u00a0participation\nRestricted access to project information\nReceipt of proprietary information\nPublication restrictions (including sponsor approval to publish)\nForeign travel\nInternational collaborations\nInternational shipment of equipment or materials\nPayments to or from OFAC restricted locations\nThe above list includes indicators that the work may be subject to export control laws.\u00a0The final determination of the applicability of the regulations depends on the specific details and the specific technology involved in the research.\u00a0The Grant & Contract Officer and Export Control and Compliance\u00a0Officer will work with the PI to assess the applicability of export control laws to the work.\nSponsor or Third Party Provided Technology\nIt is critical that incoming items and all proprietary technical information be assessed to determine whether or not they are export controlled.\nUsually the provider is the best source of information regarding the export control classification, but ultimately it is the University's responsibility to know what we are accepting and to protect it appropriately.\nAs per the EAR, the initial transfer of information from an industry sponsor to University researchers is subject to the EAR where the parties have agreed that the sponsor may withhold from publication some or all of the information so provided\nSimple operation of EAR controlled items by foreign nationals in the US generally does not require a license. Access to controlled information may require a license depending on the reasons for control, country of\u00a0citizenship, and the availability of an applicable license exception.\nTechnology Control Plans\nU.S. export control regulations define an \u201cexport\u201d to include both\u00a0physical shipments\u00a0of tangible items out of the U.S., as well as the \u201ctransmission\u201d of export controlled technology by any means, outside the U.S., or to a foreign national in the U.S.\nSending export controlled information to a foreign national, either in or outside of the U.S.\u00a0whether by fax, email, etc. is an export.\u00a0Similarly, using cloud computing servers or storing digital data on a third-party server which is located in a foreign country or is otherwise not secured,\u00a0may implicate export control violations.\u00a0If the information exported is controlled, the exporter (the person who transmitted the data) could face civil and/or criminal prosecution.\nIt is the responsibility of the user to ensure that the controlled technology or technical data is appropriately protected. Contact the ECCO if you suspect that you are in receipt of controlled technology or technical data.\nA Technology Control Plan (TCP) is required for all research which involves any ITAR controlled items or technical data, involves any EAR controlled technology,\u00a0or otherwise falls outside the Fundamental Research Exclusion (FRE). \u00a0The TCP shall include:\nA physical and information security plan.\nPersonnel screening procedures.\nA process for using and storing the information in a controlled environment.\nAll TCPs are developed by the faculty and staff involved in the research project, with help from the Export Control and Compliance\u00a0Officer (ECCO). The ECCO\u00a0must approve all TCPs prior to receipt of the controlled information or material.\nIn addition, all members of the research team will be required to read, understand, and sign the TCP before the project can begin.\nTransfer of Tangible Materials\nProviding controlled materials to foreign nationals may require an export license.\u00a0The exemption of fundamental university research from export licensing requirements doesNOTextend to the export of tangible objects from the U.S.\nPlease review theDecision Trees,Shipping InformationandImport Control Resourcesfor information on physical shipments. (/resources/export-controls-decision-trees, /resources/export-controls-procurement-and-shipping, /resources/import-control)\nIn addition\u00a0to the above,\u00a0to transfer materials out of Cornell University, please\u00a0contact CTL\u00a0to arrange for the necessary Material Transfer Agreements.\nEducation\nMost university courses are excluded from export controls in that the information released in the courses is considered to be publicly available.\nTheEARprovides that educational information released by \u2018instruction\u2019in catalog courses and associated teaching laboratories of academic institutions (with some encryption exceptions) is not subject to the EAR [EAR \u00a7734.3(b)(3)(iii) ]The EAR education exclusion does not extend to the release of information in research labs not associated with catalog courses.\nThe EAR education exclusion does not extend to the release of information in research labs not associated with catalog courses.\nTheITARprovides that information concerning general scientific, mathematical or engineering principles commonly taught in schools, colleges and universities, is not included in the definition of \u2018technical data\u2019subject to the ITAR [\u00a7120.33(b)].\nConferences\nThe EAR considers information released at an open conference, meeting, seminar, trade show, or other open gathering to be published, and so excluded from control.\nThe ITAR considers information released through unlimited distribution at a conference, meeting, seminar, trade show or exhibition, generally accessible to the public,in the United Statesto be in the public domain, and so excluded from ITAR control.\nCaution:Follow up discussions could be considered a defense service (assisting a non-US person with a defense article), if the information you provide is not in the public domain.\nControlled items, software, or technical data cannot be released in open conferences.\nExport Controls Office (/offices/export-controls-office)\nImport Control (/resources/import-control)\nOff-Campus Research (/resources/campus-research)\nExport Controls (/export-controls)\nDrusilla Jaiah - Export Control Associate (/contact/dbj43)\nJoi Mindingall - Research Security | Export Control Officer (/contact/jmm793)\nExport Control and Confidentiality Agreements (/resources/export-control-and-confidentiality-agreements)\nDetecting and Reporting Export Controls Violations (/policies/detecting-and-reporting-export-controls-violations)\nUkraine/Russia Transactions Guidance (/news/ukrainerussia-transactions-guidance)\nExport Controls Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) (/resources/export-controls-frequently-asked-questions-faq)\nUniversity Policy 4.22, Export and Import Control Compliance (https://policy.cornell.edu/policy-library/export-and-import-control-compliance)\nQuick Reference\nRates (/rates)\nForms (/forms)\nPolicies (/policies)\nContacts (/contacts)\nTraining (/training)\nEvents (/events)\nNews & Announcements (/news)\n\u00a9 2019 Cornell University\nWeb Accessibility Help (mailto:rais-help@cornell.edu?subject=researchservices.cornell.edu%20site)"

These codes and descriptions determine in which Federal Function the project will be categorized and the associated F&A rate that will be used for the project.\n41XX Instruction & Departmental Research - I&DR\n41XX Training Grants\nThe teaching and training activities of the institution. Except for the research training, this includes all instruction and training whether for credit or non-credit courses. It includes normal teaching through academic departments as well as summer school and executive education programs. This function also includes departmental research. This is sometimes known as scholarly research or teaching research. This is research that does not meet the definition of organized research, and is generally funded with gifts or University, College or Departmental discretionary funds. Departmental research consists of research supported through departmental budgets or personal funds and conducted to further teaching or personal interests. Consistent with2 CFR 200 Uniform Guidance (UG), it is all research that is not organized research and therefore not separately budgeted or accounted for. Startup funds for new faculty are generally considered to be departmental research. As a general rule, training grants do not fall under this category, but are classified as 436X \"Research Training Grants.\" (https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=3929039916bda257524bdd8a881f7ab9&mc=true&node=pt2.1.200&rgn=div5)\n43XX Organized Research\nAll research and development activities of an institution that are separately budgeted and accounted for.All sponsored research is organized research.The definition of separately budgeted and accounted for can be nebulous. It generally means a scope of work, a specific time frame, deliverables, whether technical or financial, that the University is obligated to deliver, a specific budget and facilities and administrative cost recoveries. The fact that expenses for research activity rests in a separate University account does not meet the criteria for organized research. The source of funding does not establish organized research.There can be training under this function.\n4360 Research Training Grants\nExpenditures that are externally funded and provide for the training of a specific individual in research techniques, or \"research training\" as defined inthe UG, are included in this sub-category. The expenditures normally cover stipends and tuition and may provide for general expenses and an institutional allowance or F&A recovery. (https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=3929039916bda257524bdd8a881f7ab9&mc=true&node=pt2.1.200&rgn=div5)\n44XX Extension and Public Service\nThe function that, consistent with Cornell's Land Grant responsibilities for the State of New York, disseminates non-instructional services and information to the taxpayers that support the institution. Conference activity is normally in this function.\n45XX Academic Support - Institutional Support\n47XX General Administration \u2013 College Administration \u2013 Departmental Administration\n456X Library\nAdministrative support of the academic functions of the University. This function captures a significant amount of the general and administrative costs of the University, along with significant college administrative costs. Departmental administration can be captured in these functions, but is generally recorded in the direct functions of the University. This function also records the library function.\n46XX Student Services\nExpenses for student-related expenses. This includes activities such as the Bursar, Registrar, the Dean of Students, etc. and captures expenses at the University, College and Departmental level.\n48XX Operation and Maintenance O&M\nThis function records costs for the operation and maintenance of the physical plant and infrastructure of the University. It includes utilities, repair and maintenance, facilities management, space-related costs, etc.\n5000, 6000 University & Student Enterprise Activities\nDirect functions that are not part of the mission of the University, but without which the other direct functions of I&DR, Research and Public Service cannot exist. This function includes such things as dining, housing, campus stores, etc.\nQuick Reference\nRates (/rates)\nForms (/forms)\nPolicies (/policies)\nContacts (/contacts)\nTraining (/training)\nEvents (/events)\nNews & Announcements (/news)\n\u00a9 2019 Cornell University\nWeb Accessibility Help (mailto:rais-help@cornell.edu?subject=researchservices.cornell.edu%20site)"

SFS will forward a copy of the financial report to units upon request.\nFinancial Management (/compliance/financial-management)\nUkraine/Russia Transactions Guidance (/news/ukrainerussia-transactions-guidance)\nSalary Certification (/resources/salary-certification)\nMonitoring Project Expenditures (/resources/monitoring-project-expenditures)\nMonitoring Cost Sharing in a Project (/resources/monitoring-cost-sharing-project)\nDirect and Indirect Cost Examples (/resources/direct-and-indirect-cost-examples)\nDiverse Suppliers Requirements (/resources/diverse-suppliers-requirements)\nUse of Foreign Airlines on Federal Funds (/resources/use-foreign-airlines-federal-funds)\nFinancial Management of Sponsored Projects Policies and Procedures (/policies/financial-management-sponsored-projects-policies-and-procedures)\nQuick Reference\nRates (/rates)\nForms (/forms)\nPolicies (/policies)\nContacts (/contacts)\nTraining (/training)\nEvents (/events)\nNews & Announcements (/news)\n\u00a9 2019 Cornell University\nWeb Accessibility Help (mailto:rais-help@cornell.edu?subject=researchservices.cornell.edu%20site)"

The Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP) uses the following procedures and guidelines regarding award acceptance and to determine the U.S. dollar (USD) value of agreements made with foreign currency.\nReason for Procedure:Minimize foreign exchange risk to the University and identify responsibilities for the Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP), Sponsored Financial Services (SFS), and university units.\nResponsibilities\nOSP Responsibility:Be aware of risks involving the acceptance of agreements with terms in foreign currency, and negotiate with the sponsor to obtain the most favorable terms to mitigate such risk. Clearly identify the currency and exchange rates used for award valuation in RASS.\nSFS Responsibility:Issue invoices in accordance with the award, clearly identify the currency on the billing invoice, revalue the unexpended authorized portion of the award when foreign currency payments are received, and notify OSP to update award value in RASS.\nPI/Unit Responsibility:Monitor the award as appropriate to minimize the risk of currency fluctuation. Accept responsibility for any shortfalls, or benefit from any gains in the awarded amount, due to the foreign exchange rate.\nProcedures\nOSP should negotiate with the sponsor to set the agreement amount in U.S. dollars (USD) prior to final acceptance, whenever possible. If the sponsor will not convert the agreement to USD, advise the PI of the possible risks and:\nNegotiate to set payment terms as \"payment in full upon execution of the agreement.\" This will allow for a one-time currency exchange and reduce risk and possible loss of dollars; or\nNegotiate to set terms for a schedule of payments, remembering to obtain as much up front as possible to reduce risk due to fluctuation in the exchange rate; or\nNegotiate for monthly, quarterly, etc., reimbursement of costs. The exchange rate used would be the rate current at the time payment was received from the sponsor.\nRecord the award in RASS at the USD value obtained from theOanda Currency Converterat the time of execution. (https://www.oanda.com/currency/converter/)\nSFS will validate the conversion of the agreement to USD, regardless of the method of payment, at the time an account is established using theOanda Currency Converter. The agreement amount will be subsequently revalued at the time of each payment, and the PI/Unit is responsible for any shortfall or benefit from any gains. SFS will notify OSP of any fluctuation in the agreement amount.

collected by another researcher, storing data you yourself have collected from human research participants, or conducting Internet- or app-based research, you must take adequate steps to protect the privacy and confidentiality of research data.\nResearch with human participants frequently involves analysis or collection of personal identifying information (\"identifiers\").\u00a0 In reviewing proposed human participant research, the IRB will consider whether data to be analyzed or collected by the researcher could be stigmatizing, result in criminal or civil liability, damage financial standing, employability, insurability, or reputation, result in stolen identity, or otherwise pose a threat to an individual\u2019s privacy or confidentiality.\u00a0 If so, the researcher should describe steps they will take to ensure that such information is kept secure.\nBroadly, human participant research should be planned with the following in mind:\nEnsuring that the informed consent process adequately and accurately explains to potential participants about possible risks of participation, including any risk that their personal data may be compromised.\nAppropriatelysafeguarding the privacy or confidentiality of information obtained from or about human participants, and documenting these procedures in the protocol application and consent form.\nMinimizingpotential risks to participants, including risks associated with accidental or malicious security breaches.\nResources\nData Storage Finder tool: the Cornell Data Services group (formerly Research Data Management Services Group--RDMSG) operates this online tool to help you select an appropriate method for collecting and storing your research data (https://finder.research.cornell.edu/)\nRegulated Data Chart:

Although the cells may come from eligible sources, the following uses of these cells are nevertheless ineligible for NIH funding, as follows:\nResearch in which hESCs (even if derived from embryos donated in accordance with these Guidelines) or human induced pluripotent stem cells are introduced into non-human primate blastocysts.\nResearch involving the breeding of animals where the introduction of hESCs (even if derived from embryos donated in accordance with these Guidelines) or human induced pluripotent stem cells may contribute to the germ line.\nOther Research Not Eligible for NIH Funding\nNIH funding of the derivation of stem cells from human embryos is prohibited by the annual appropriations ban on funding of human embryo research (Section 509, Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009, Pub. L. 111-8, 3/11/09), otherwise known as the Dickey Amendment.\nResearch using hESCs derived from other sources, including somatic cell nuclear transfer, parthenogenesis, and/or IVF embryos created for research purposes, is not eligible for NIH funding.\nRegulations and Resources\nNIH Guidelines for Human Stem Cell Research (https://stemcells.nih.gov/research-policy-and-faqs)\nOn March 9, 2009, President Barack H. Obama issued\u00a0Executive Order 13505: Removing Barriers to Responsible Scientific Research Involving Human Stem Cells. The Executive Order stated that the Secretary of Health and Human Services, through the Director of NIH, may support and conduct responsible, scientifically worthy human stem cell research, including human embryonic stem cell (hESC) research, to the extent permitted by law. On July 7, 2009 theNIH issued its guidelinesfor the implementation of Executive Order 13505, as it pertains to extramural NIH-funded stem cell research. These guidelines were developed to \u201censure that NIH-funded research in this area is ethically responsible, scientifically worthy, and conducted in accordance with applicable law.\u201d (https://stemcells.nih.gov/research-policy-and-faqs)\nThough the Obama administration has made possible broader funding for work with existing stem cell lines, the Dickey-Wicker Amendment still prohibits the federal government from funding any research that involves the destruction of human embryos, including the derivation of new stem cell lines. Therefore the NIH Guidelines specifically state that \u201cprior to the use of NIH funds, funding recipients should provide assurances, when endorsing applications and progress reports submitted to NIH for projects using hESCs, that the hESCs are listed on the\u00a0NIH registry.\u201d\nNational Academy of Sciences Guidelines for Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research (https://www.nap.edu/catalog/12923/final-report-of-the-national-academies-human-embryonic-stem-cell-research-advisory-committee-and-2010-amendments-to-the-national-academies-guidelines-for-human-embryonic-stem-cell-research)\nThe National Academy of Sciences developed its first set of ethical standards for stem cell research in 2005.

Write in a style understandable by an educated layperson.\nInclude:\nSpecific aims of your research. If your research involves multiple projects, you can list the aims of each project in separate paragraphs.\nOverview of experimental methods.\nThe use of research materials with animals.\nThe level of detail should be similar to how you would write an introduction to your research for a website.\nDo not:\nCopy and paste from a grant application.\nCopy and paste from another compliance application (ex. an IACUC or IRB protocol)\nBelow is a sample IBC project description:\nWe work with genes of Salmonella that are required for virulence.Salmonella is a pathogen that affects human and a wide range of other animal species, including mammals, birds, and reptiles.We are specifically interested in the genes that Salmonella requires to penetrate the intestinal epithelium of mammalian hosts and those that are required for the organism to grow ni produce plants, specifically tomatoes.The expression of these genes is controlled by numerous genetic regulators and environmental conditions.To understand how these genes are controlled, we often make mutations in genes that we think likely to be required, and then assess changes in virulence gene expression.We also test various environmental conditions, including changing amino acid or fatty acid concentrations in the growth media or altering pH on the control of these genes.The assays used to assess this include the use of reporter fusions, reverse transcription PCR, secreted protein profiles, and virulence in mice.\nWe use recombinant DNA when make mutations in Salmonella using selectable antibiotic markers, and when we clone genes in experiments to complement the phenotypes we observe.Genes under study are cloned and expressed on cloning vectors in laboratory strains of E. coli as a means to amplify the genes.These plasmids are then transferred back to mutant strains of Salmonella to test for restoration of the wild type phenotype.\nIn addition, we make reporter fusions using genes that produce a measurable signal, inserted into the Salmonella chromosome or carried on a plasmid downstream from genes of interest.The reporter genes we use are lacZ, producing b-galactosidase; fluorescent protein genes and provide fluorescence, and luciferase genes that produce visible light.\nThe first goal of our work is to understand how Salmonella is able to sense and respond to the environmental conditions that exist within a host to induce genes that are required for virulence.The primary approaches we use are the following:\n1. We make mutations in Salmonella of genes that we anticipate will reduce the ability of the bacterium to infect hosts. These genes might be identified by bioinformatic analyses, by studying specific metabolic pathways, or using screens and selections.We make null mutants using established techniques.\n2.We test the expression of virulence genes using reporter fusions, primarily lacZ and gfp, in various mutant strains and under differing environmental conditions.We are particularly interested in the ability of fatty acids to alter the expression of virulence genes and so grow Salmonella in laboratory media with or without fatty acids added (formate, acetate, propionate, and butyrate) for these experiments.\n3.We use quantitative reverse transcription PCR to assess the expression of Salmonella genes when the bacteria are grown under various environmental conditions or in differing mutant strains.\n4.We assess the profile of proteins secreted into culture media by Salmonella under various environmental conditions or in differing mutant strains.Certain virulence proteins are secreted and so these assays measure the potential for virulence.\n5.We determine general characteristics of mutant bacteria, including growth rate, motility, and auxotrophy.\n6.We infect mice with wild type and mutant strains to assess virulence.\nIn our laboratory, the vast majority of the time we use a single strain for the production of all of the other strains we study:Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain ATCC14028.This strain was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and was originally derived from a cow.We use it specifically because it is virulent in mice and because it has been used in many published studies.\nIn the course of our work, we make many mutants of ATCC14028.Because we study virulence, many of the mutants have defects in virulence genes, and so are less virulent than the parental strain.In some cases, the mutant strains have mutations that are neutral with regard to virulence, and so maintain the same virulence as the parent strain.We do not make mutants that are any more virulent than the parent.\nA second goal of this work is to identify the genes of Salmonella that are required for its survival and proliferation in tomatoes.\n1. We identify genes that may be important for the interaction of Salmonella with the plant by screening for Salmonella genes that are specifically expressed or are required for survival when the organism is living within the fruit of the tomato.In one approach, we digest Salmonella genomic DNA of with restriction enzymes and clone it into a reporter strain that allows identification of promoters of genes that are selectively expressed within the tomato, but not in laboratory media.In a second approach, we make random mutations in the Salmonella genome using a transposon, pass this mutant library through tomatoes, and then use sequencing methods to identify mutants that cannot survive in tomatoes.\nFor these screens, we make small holes in the stem end of tomatoes using blunt needles.Tomatoes are inoculated through these holes with small volumes (~20 ul) of Salmonella culture.After incubation, tomatoes are cored using a blunt serrated knife (i.e. a table knife).Material is placed within a Whil-Pak bag and manually crushed.Liquid material is then removed and plated onto agar plates for isolation of Salmonella.Coring of tomatoes is performed in a BSC.Once the tomato pieces are contained within bags, the work is shifted to the lab bench.\n2.Once in planta-induced genes are identified, we make mutations of these genes in the Salmonella chromosome.Mutant strains are then tested for their survival in tomatoes.The assay for survival in tomatoes is identical to that of the screening method described immediately above.\nThe mutations that we make are designed to affect the ability of the organism to survive in tomatoes. It is possible that they would also reduce the virulence in humans and animals. In no case would we expect any mutation to increase virulence or host range of the organism.For these assays, we use Salmonella serovar Montevideo strain BAA-710, derived from a human case of salmonellosis due to contamination of tomatoes.\nRarely, we use other Salmonella strains in the lab.The most common is Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain LT2.This is a laboratory strain that is known to be less virulent than others due to a specific mutation in the rpoS gene.It is a pan-susceptible strain.We have occasionally used Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain 798, which was derived from a pig and is used in pig infection studies.It is also pan-susceptible.\nBL2-P/BSL2 for plants\nBelow are required practices for working with plants under BL2-P/BSL2 for Plants.\nFor BL2-P containment please include the following.\nAccess to the greenhouse/growth chamber is limited or restricted to those persons directly involved in the project when experiments are in progress.\nAccess to the greenhouse/growth chamber is limited or restricted to those persons directly involved in the project when experiments are in progress.\nPersonnel are required to read instructions on BL2-P greenhouse practices and procedures, and to follow them.\nPersonnel are required to read instructions on BL2-P greenhouse practices and procedures, and to follow them.\nAll procedures are performed in accordance with practices appropriate to the experimental organism.\u00a0 Failure to carry out these practices may result in the release of the recombinant organism into the environment.\u00a0 This may lead to the premature termination of the experiment.\nAll procedures are performed in accordance with practices appropriate to the experimental organism.\u00a0 Failure to carry out these practices may result in the release of the recombinant organism into the environment.\u00a0 This may lead to the premature termination of the experiment.\nA record is kept of the experiments in progress in the greenhouse/growth chamber facility.

In order to fulfill this responsibility Cornell University has established an Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), charged with oversight responsibilities for all research related activities involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules and other biohazardous materials.\nObjectives\nThe IBC's primary objective is to safeguard protection of personnel, the general public, and the environment. To meet this goal, the IBC imposes requirements for safe laboratory and biological safety practices; reviews and approves policies, procedures, training, programs and facilities pursuant to the safe use of biological agents, other biological materials, and biotoxins.\nThe IBC is responsible for:\nReview and approval of the research activities involving r/sNA or other biohazardous materials on a regular and continuing basis.\nIndependently assess the containment levels of the work, as required by theNIH Guidelines, for all experiments, including those involving whole plants and/or animals, cell cultures, tissues, human-derived materials, biological toxins, infectious agents, and regulated pathogens and pests.\nAssess the facilities, procedures, practices, and training and expertise of personnel involved with r/sNA and biohazardous research.\nLower the containment levels for certain experiments in which DNA from Risk Group 2, 3, or 4 or Restricted Agents is cloned into nonpathogenic prokaryotic or lower eukaryotic host-vector systems.\nPerform periodic reviews or require modifications of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules or biohazardous research and research facilities at Cornell to ensure compliance with theNIH Guidelinesand other government regulations.\nNotify the Principal Investigator of the results of the IBC's review and approval.\nAdopt emergency plans covering accidental spills and personnel contamination resulting from research using recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules.\nReport significant problems with or violations of theNIH Guidelinesand any significant research related accidents or illnesses to ORIA and the appropriate institutional official and when necessary to NIH/OBA.\nIn cooperation with ORIA, suspend or terminate approval of research that is not being conducted in accordance with the IBC's requirements.\nCommittee Membership\nFederal Regulations(NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules)require that membership of the IBC include at a minimum, five members, who collectively have experience in general issues of laboratory biosafety, use of infectious materials, and expertise in recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule technology and the capability to assess the safety of such research and identify any potential risk to public health or the environment. The membership is composed of: at least one faculty member with expertise in plant, plant pathogen, or plant pest containment principles; one faculty member with expertise in animal containment principles, gene therapy in animals, viral pathogens and vectors, microbial pathogens, biotoxins and biotechnology; the Institutional Biological Safety Officer when research is conducted at BL3, BL4, or Large Scale (greater than 10 liters); one member of the laboratory technical staff; and two members not affiliated with the institution (apart from their membership on the committee).\nBecause Cornell is a large institution, additional members are included to provide adequate representation of the diverse research community. In order to ensure that the committee has expertise required to review and approve the wide range of research activities, ad hoc consultants will be used as deemed necessary.\nThe following individuals are voting members of the current IBC:\nJulie Siler, Research Technician, Public and Ecosystem Health\nEdward Koppel, Occupational Medicine Physician, ex-officio\nProfessor Georg Jander, Boyce Thompson Institute\nPaul Jennette, Biosafety Engineer, CVM Biosafety Program\nChristy Michaels, Non-affiliated member*\nCathy Moseley, Non-affiliated member*\nProfessor Colin Parrish, James A.

Case studies issued by NIH describe certain fundamental health-related research previously assumed to be outside of the definition. For federally-funded research that meets the Common Rule definition of clinical trial, Principle Investigators (PIs) have one or more new compliance obligations, depending on the exact funding source. (https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials.htm)\nTo facilitate compliance with these additional requirements for clinical trials, approval letters will specify that a project meets the definition of a \u201cclinical trial\u201d when the IRB determines that this is the case, and summarize requirements that may apply as a result. If your study is a clinical trial you as the researcher are ultimately responsible for ensuring compliance with the obligations summarized here:\nAny federal funding:For clinical trials supported by any type of federal funding (NIH, NSF, DOD, etc.), the PI is required to comply with the consent posting requirement described below. In addition, the IRB recommends that federally-funded researchers voluntarily comply with obligations described below that are mandatory only for NIH-funded researchers conducting a clinical trial:\nConsent form posting: The PI must post a copy of an IRB-approved consent form used for enrollment purposes toClinicalTrials.govafter the study is closed to recruitment, but no later than 60 days after the last study visit by any subject. (See additionalOHRP guidanceon this topic.) Please note that the IRB office will not be able to remind PIs to fulfill this obligation in a timely manner. (https://clinicaltrials.gov/, https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/informed-consent-posting/informed-consent-posting-guidance/index.html)\nNIH funding:If you are a PI who has or is seeking NIH funding for a clinical trial, you are responsible for meeting the following additional compliance obligations:\nApply for the correct FOA: Certain NIH Funding Opportunity Announcements (FOAs) are applicable only to CTs or non-CTs. Applying for the wrong FOA may make your submission ineligible for funding.\nRegistration and reporting onClinicaltrials.gov: Clinical trials in competing applications and contract proposals submitted on or after January 18, 2017 must register, submit updates throughout the project, and post results information onClinicaltrials.gov. Compliance with this requirement is expected to require a significant dedication of time and effort throughout the study. You should register your study onClinicaltrials.govas early as possible (e.g., concurrent with your IRB protocol submission, or right after obtaining IRB approval). The Cornell IRB staff are available to provide assistance if requested, but researchers are primarily responsible for complying with these obligations. (https://clinicaltrials.gov/, https://clinicaltrials.gov/, https://clinicaltrials.gov/)\nTraining in Good Clinical Practices (GCP): Starting January 1, 2017, those involved in the design, conduct, oversight, or management of a NIH clinical trial must be trained in GCP. As a condition of protocol approval, the Cornell IRB will require evidence that all study personnel listed on the protocol have completed GCP training within the last 3 years. NIH does not specify any particular GCP course. Cornell researchers may complete GCP training online through theCITI Program. Note that this training is in addition to basic IRB training required by the IRB. (/training/citi-online-courses-cornell-researchers-coi-irb-rcr-export-control)\nConsent form posting: This requirement is described above.\nAll other projects:Regardless of the funding status or source for your human subjects work, the Cornell IRB strongly recommends that you choose to follow the compliance practices required by NIH as a best practice. Publication in certain journals could be jeopardized if researchers fail to comply with these best practices.\nTraining in Good Clinical Practice (GCP):Researchers on a clinical trialmust be trained in GCP. All study personnel listed on the protocol must have completed GCP training within the last 3 years. GCP training can be completed online throughCITIand is in addition to the IRB training.

We hope your semester is off to a promising start. As we move further into fall, we want to inform you about some updates regarding in-person human research studies and other things going on in the Cornell IRB world.\nCONTENTS1. Updated IRB guidance on research during the COVID-19 pandemic2. New online IRB system in development3. Tips on submitting a new protocol application\n1. Updated IRB guidance on research during the COVID-19 pandemic\nWe recently updated ourguidance for researchers conducting on-campus human participant research during the COVID-19 pandemic. This guidance is a living document and will continue to be updated periodically as New York State and Cornell University public health restrictions change. We encourage all researchers to review the document, as well as theIRB COVID-19 FAQs webpage. Below are some changes we want to highlight: (/policies/irb-policy-guidance-person-research-during-covid-19-pandemic, /resources/irb-covid-19-faqs)\nResearchers and study participants generally must adhere to the same campus-wide public health requirements as other Cornell community members and visitors to campus. Learn about Cornell\u2019s current face masking and physical distancing requirements on the mainCornell COVID-19 Response website. (https://covid.cornell.edu/)\nIf your human participant research project involves procedures that don't meet the campus public health requirements, then the protocol will need additional review from EHS (Environment, Health and Safety). Please reach out to the IRB team, and we will help facilitate this review.\nAs part of revising IRB guidance for research during the pandemic, theSample Study Participant COVID-19 Information Sheetand theStudy Participant Self-Screening Attestationhave been updated. They can also be found at the bottom of theIRB COVID-19 guidance webpage. (/sites/default/files/2020-07/Cornell%20IRB%20-%20Sample%20Study%20Participant%20COVID-19%20Information%20Sheet.docx, /sites/default/files/2020-07/Cornell%20IRB%20-%20Sample%20Study%20Participant%20COVID-19%20Self-Screening%20Attestation.docx, /policies/irb-policy-guidance-person-research-during-covid-19-pandemic)\n2. New online IRB system in development\nWe are very excited to announce that a new online IRB protocol management system is being developed! It is being built on the same platform as the Sponsored Research system (called theResearch Administration Support System, aka RASS). We anticipate transitioning to the new system in 2022. The new system will help streamline many of the IRB submission and review processes, making it easier to keep track of your protocols and communications with the IRB administrative team, and hopefully shorten review times, as well. (https://rass.cornell.edu)\nThere is still a lot of work to be done prior to launching the new system, and we will be in touch with the research community more often in the coming months. Please keep an eye out for updates. If you are interested in helping us test the new system, please email us atirbhp@cornell.edu. We have also been working hard to clean up the protocol records in our current system in order to prepare to migrate the data to the new system; some of you may have already heard about this project over the summer, when we were emailing investigators about closing older protocols. If you have any other protocol that can be closed*, please emailirbhp@cornell.eduto let us know. The fewer protocols we migrate to the new system, the easier the migration and data validation process will be. Thank you for your support and assistance! (mailto:irbhp@cornell.edu, mailto:irbhp@cornell.edu)\n*IRB Protocols can be closed if they meet the following criteria:1. Any enrollment of participants is permanently closed;2. All participant interventions and interactions are complete, including collection of long-term follow-up data/samples;3. No additional identifiable private information will be obtained; and4. Any analysis of identifiable private information is complete.Note: Once an IRB protocol has been closed, investigators may continue to perform data analysis, manuscript preparation, and publication activities, as long as identifiable information is NOT being accessed. Data and samples\u2014including identifiable private information\u2014may be kept after a protocol has been closed, in accordance with the IRB-approved research plan and informed consent documents. If you plan to use those identifiable data/samples for future research, you must obtain IRB approval prior to beginning the new research project.\n3. Tips on submitting a new protocol application\nWhether you are new to human subjects research or have past experience with the IRB, we hope these tips will help to guide you through the IRB application process:\nThe Forms\u2013 We are currently using a paper-based process, so all application forms are available for download on our website. The forms can be digitally filled out, and then attached in an email sent toirbhp@cornell.edu. You can find thenew protocol application formhere(which should be used for all protocol review types, including those that may be exempt), and theamendment request formhere. (mailto:irbhp@cornell.edu, /forms/irb-new-protocol-application-form, /forms/irb-amendment-form)\nDecision Tree\u2013 When preparing a new project, consult theHuman Subjects Decision Treeto determine whether your project requires any sort of IRB review. This tree is designed to give you better understanding of how Human Research Protection Program staff determine whether projects meet the regulatory definition of human subjects research. As always, check with the IRB team (irbhp@cornell.edu) if you have questions or if you need an official determination. (/sites/default/files/2019-05/IRB%20Decision%20Tree.pdf, mailto:irbhp@cornell.edu)\nReview/Approval Times\u2013 Please expect,at minimum, 2-3 weeks for exempt reviews, 3-4 weeks for expedited reviews, 2-3 weeks for exempt or expedited amendments, and 4-6 weeks for all full board reviews. We are a small team that handles 125 submissions, on average, each month. We appreciate your continued patience.\nTraining\u2013 Have all members of your research team complete the onlinehuman subjects research ethicstraining, ideally prior to submission of your application.Note: while the training is currently not required for exempt research, we always strongly recommend it, regardless of review level. (/resources/irb-training)\nFor students,consult your faculty advisorin designing your study, as well as for review and sign-off on the final IRB protocol application and research materials. You must include your advisor\u2019s signature on the application form, or their attestation via email, when submitting a new protocol, amendment, or request for continuing review.\nConsult theIRB FAQsto inform your study design and materials. Consult theIRB COVID-19 FAQsto inform your research activities during the COVID-19 pandemic.

After receipt of a fully executed award from the prime sponsor, the award is distributed to the PI and the unit by OSP.\nThe PI and unit are responsible for initiating the request to issue a subaward to OSP via RASS.See step-by step directions. (https://guide.rass.cornell.edu/sponsored-projects/initiate-a-subaward/)\nPIs/Units should initiate this request as soon as possible after they receive a fully executed prime award distribution notification. The information requested via RASS is necessary for the OSP Subward Team to draft the subaward and ensure that the proper steps and determinations have been made prior to the issuance of the subaward.\nIf the subrecipient was not proposed in Cornell's original proposal, prime sponsor approval may be necessary prior to issuance of the subaward.\nPrior approval may also be necessary even if the subrecipient was proposed in the original proposal.\nIn some very rare instances, prime sponsors request to review and approve the proposed subaward prior to Cornell's release of the subaward to the subrecipient.\nAdvance Payments to Subrecipients\nRequests for advance payments to subrecipients will be considered only in very unusual circumstances and on a case-by-case basis. Advance payment terms are written into the subagreement and the advance payment, if approved by OSP and Sponsored Financial Services (SFS), is issued after a fully executed subaward agreement is in place.\nAdvance payments are generally not allowed because:\nSponsor guidelines typically state that subrecipients are reimbursed for expenses incurred for performing the work.\nCornell does not usually receive advance funding from its sponsors, therefore as a matter of practice, Cornell does not advance funds to a subrecipient.\nPrepaying an award reduces the university\u2019s leverage for ensuring that the scope of work is delivered, therefore it is considered poor fiscal management to advance funds to a subrecipient.\nManaging Subawards (/process/managing-subawards)\nSubaward FAQs (/resources/subaward-faqs)\nSubawards: Roles and Responsibilities (/resources/subawards-roles-and-responsibilities)\nSubcontractor Commitment Form (/forms/subcontractor-commitment-form)\nFederal Demonstration Partnership (FDP) Expanded Clearinghouse Program (/resources/federal-demonstration-partnership-fdp-expanded-clearinghouse-program)\nSubawards: Risk Assessment (/resources/subawards-risk-assessment)\nPayments to Subrecipients on Sponsored Projects (/resources/payments-subrecipients-sponsored-projects)\nAmendment to Subaward Agreements (/resources/amendment-subaward-agreements)\nSubrecipient Monitoring: Financial and Technical (/resources/subrecipient-monitoring-financial-and-technical)\nQuick Reference\nRates (/rates)\nForms (/forms)\nPolicies (/policies)\nContacts (/contacts)\nTraining (/training)\nEvents (/events)\nNews & Announcements (/news)\n\u00a9 2019 Cornell University\nWeb Accessibility Help (mailto:rais-help@cornell.edu?subject=researchservices.cornell.edu%20site)"

These procedures must be conducted in a manner that assures the safety and privacy of participants. Many such procedures must be conducted in specialized spaces on campus, to ensure that research support is appropriately provided, with trained and qualified personnel conducting the procedures. For detailed information on working with these facilities or conducting any biomedical research on campus, please reviewIRB Policy #19. (/policies/irb-policy-19-use-physiological-devices-biomedical-procedures-or-biological-samples-human)\nGeneral Guidance for Preparing an IRB Application with Biomedical Procedures\nWhen submitting an IRB application involving biomedical procedures, follow the steps and include the information and documents described below:\nSubmit a New Protocol\nCreate a new protocol in RASS-IRB (https://rass.cornell.edu/irb)\nHow-to documentation for how to create a new protocol or complete other tasks in RASS-IRB is available on theRASS Guide Site. (http://guide.rass.cornell.edu/)\nCreating a Consent Form for Biomedical Procedures\nAll IRB applications involving active collection of specimens must include a consent form. Below please find a general biomedical consent form template that can be adapted for your needs. Note, if your application involves blood draws or fMRI, specific consent forms for these procedures need to be used. You can find these consent templates in the section below concerning specific biomedical procedures.\nEditable consent form for biomedical procedures (general) (/sites/default/files/2019-05/IRB%20consent%20template%20-%20biomedical.doc)\nGuides and Templates for Specific Biomedical Procedures\nBlood Draws Using Venipuncture\nReview the guidance below before you start planning for blood draws for research. It contains useful links and resources that will help to make the application and review process go smoothly and fast. We strongly recommend that researchers use the research support services for blood draws offered by Gannett Health Services or the HMRU.\nRead this first:IRB Guidance: Venipuncture (/policies/venipuncture-guidance-research-human-subjects, /policies/venipuncture-guidance-research-human-subjects)\nThe standard, IRB-approved consent language and standard operating procedures (SOP) for blood draws are provided in the templates below. Researchers are welcome to edit the templates for their project, but are encouraged only to make those changes to standard language that are truly necessary, as any material changes will need to be reviewed by Occupational Medicine and the IRB, and may add additional time to the protocol approval process.\nEditable Standard Operating Procedure and Take Home Sheet: Venipuncture(to be used only if blood draws are not being done at Cornell Health Services) (/sites/default/files/2019-05/Editable%20SOP%20for%20Venipuncture%202016.docx)\nEditable Consent Form: Venipuncture (/sites/default/files/2019-05/Template%20venipuncture%20Consent%20Form%202016.docx)\nBlood Draws Using Finger Stick\nThe standard, IRB-approved consent language and standard operating procedures (SOP) for capillary blood draws (also known as finger sticks) are provided in the templates below. Researchers are welcome to edit the templates for their project, but are encouraged only to make those changes to standard language that are truly necessary, as any material changes will need to be reviewed by Occupational Medicine and the IRB, and may add additional time to the protocol approval process.\nEditable Standard Operating Procedure and Take Home Sheet: Finger Stick (/sites/default/files/2019-05/Editable%20SOP%20for%20Finger%20Stick%202016.docx)\nEditable Consent Form: Finger Stick (/sites/default/files/2019-05/Template%20Finger%20Stick%20Consent%20Form%202016.docx)\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)\nTheCornell MRI Facility(CMRIF) is a university-wide resource located on the ground floor of Martha Van Rensselaer Hall. For all scans with human participants performed in the CMRIF, use this CMRIF- and IRB-approvedinformed consent form template. (https://www.human.cornell.edu/hd/research/labs/mri/home, /sites/default/files/2021-03/CMRIF_template_consent_form%20%5Bapproved%5D.docx)\nPlease edit the consent template for your project, but only make those changes that are truly necessary; any material changes will need to be reviewed by Occupational Medicine and the IRB, and will add additional time to the protocol review process. When submitting your IRB protocol application, please provide both a tracked-changes and clean version of your CMRIF consent form.\nPlease contact theCMRIFdirectly for more information about how the facility works and other resources for researchers. (https://www.human.cornell.edu/hd/research/labs/mri/home)\nOther Biomedical Procedures\nContact the Human Metabolic Research Unit (HMRU)for guidance on urine sample collection, pregnancy testing, and respiratory tracking studies.

In addition to Cornell IRB approval, some international research must also be approved by the local equivalent of an IRB. Where there is no equivalent board or committee, researchers should work with local NGOs, researchers or community leaders to ensure that the project is consistent with cultural and legal expectations, and to secure support for the conduct of the research. As part of its review, the Cornell IRB will require a letter demonstrating support from an appropriate local body, organization or individual who will cooperate with and support the researcher. Researchers are urged to plan for the additional time that will be needed to obtain and document local support and review, and for the Cornell IRB to then review these important documents. Please seeIRB Policy: International Human Researchfor more information. (/policies/irb-policy-14-international-human-research)\nBoth the U.S. and host country standards for protecting human participants must be respected through the IRB review and approval process and the conduct of the research. Where the two sets of standards present a conflict, the research must meet the higher standard. In particular, while we do not impose our standards for written documentation on other cultures, we do not relax our standards for ethical conduct of research or for a meaningful consent and/or assent process, including ensuring additional protections for vulnerable participant populations (e.g., children, prisoners).\nDue to U.S. export regulations, Cornell researchers cannot send money or provide other transactions of value (e.g., gift cards, presents) to study participants in any of these locations: Cuba, Russia, certain regions of Ukraine, Iran, North Korea, and Syria.\nGDPR: European Data Regulation Impacts Research (/news/gdpr-european-data-regulation-impacts-research)\nIRB Policy #14: International Human Research (/policies/irb-policy-14-international-human-research)\nAbout the IRB Committee (/resources/about-irb-committee)\nThe Life Cycle of an IRB Protocol (/resources/life-cycle-irb-protocol)\nIRB Announcements & Newsletters (/resources/irb-announcements-newsletters)\nResearch with Human Participants (/compliance/human-research)\nIRB Informed Consent (/resources/irb-informed-consent)\nIRB Training (/resources/irb-training)\nIRB Considerations: Human Participant Data, Data Sets and Internet Research (/resources/human-participant-data)\nIRB Biomedical Research (/resources/irb-biomedical-research)\nIRB Considerations for Clinical Trials (/resources/irb-considerations-clinical-trials)\nQuick Reference\nRates (/rates)\nForms (/forms)\nPolicies (/policies)\nContacts (/contacts)\nTraining (/training)\nEvents (/events)\nNews & Announcements (/news)\n\u00a9 2019 Cornell University\nWeb Accessibility Help (mailto:rais-help@cornell.edu?subject=researchservices.cornell.edu%20site)"

However, if the PI needs additional time to complete the approved scope of work, within the limit of funds already made available, the sponsor may consider a request to extend the expiration date of the award at no additional cost.\nMost federal sponsors do not consider the fact that funds remain unobligated at the expiration of the award as sufficient justification for an extension of time. Normally, no single extension may exceed twelve months and only in exceptional cases will more than one extension be granted.\nProcedures for No-Cost Extensions\nThe request must be submitted to OSPusing the change request in RASS.(No-Cost Extensions cannot be requested solely for the purpose of\u00a0utilizing\u00a0remaining funds.)Requestsmustbe submitted to the sponsor by OSP. (http://guide.rass.cornell.edu/)\nIf the project involves the use of humans or animals as research subjects, an updated approval valid for the length of the extension will be necessary.\nIf the portion of the work that involved the use of research subjects is completed, a statement indicating such should be provided.\nThe request should generally contain:\nThe length of time for which the extension is being requested and a justification for the extension.\nA brief statement as to progress and work remaining to be completed.\nAn estimate of funds expected to remain unobligated on the scheduled expiration date.\nUnder the \"Uniform Guidance 2 CFR\u00a0\u00a7200.308 Revision of budget and program plans,\"\u00a0the first\u00a0request for a no-cost extension under all participating Federal agencies (except the Office of Naval Research)\u00a0may be approved by the Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP).

After OSP approval of a request, a letter (or for NSF, a FastLane notification) is sent to the sponsor via the program official, with a copy to the grants official.\nSecond no-cost extension\u00a0requests require the approval and\u00a0written authorization of the sponsor. These requests must be submitted to the sponsor forty-five (45) days prior to the expiration of the award and therefore requires the departmental request at least fifty (50) days prior.\nNote: Sponsored Financial Services (SFS) will not extend a project without written notification. If no written notification is received before the report is due, a financial report will be sent to the sponsor under the original end date.\u00a0Should a no-cost extension be received after the reporting period, the end date will be changed, and the project may continue\nProject Modifications (/manage/changes-and-deliverables)\nBudget Revisions (/resources/budget-revisions)\nChange in PI or Key Personnel and Effort (/resources/change-pi-or-key-personnel-and-effort)\nAmendment to Subaward Agreements (/resources/amendment-subaward-agreements)\nQuick Reference\nRates (/rates)\nForms (/forms)\nPolicies (/policies)\nContacts (/contacts)\nTraining (/training)\nEvents (/events)\nNews & Announcements (/news)\n\u00a9 2019 Cornell University\nWeb Accessibility Help (mailto:rais-help@cornell.edu?subject=researchservices.cornell.edu%20site)"

Some circumstances may require transferring expenditures to or from a sponsored account after the initial charge is recorded in the general ledger.\u00a0Reviewing sponsored project account activity should include determining that charges are reasonable, allowable and that they directly support the scope of work for the project. To be allowable, the transfer request must be timely, fully documented, conform to university and sponsor allowability standards, and have appropriate authorization.\nProper management of funds is essential to uphold the fiduciary responsibilities of the university. Frequent late, inadequately documented, and unexplained transfers, especially those that involve sponsored projects with overruns or unexpended balances, raise serious questions about the propriety of the transfers and may result in expenditure disallowances and/or a subsequent reduction in funding. Knowledge of award and policy requirements and ongoing monitoring will improve the quality of financial reporting, improve compliance with regulatory requirements, and reduce the administrative burden and risks inherent in document corrections.\nCorrecting Errors\nWhen there are expenditure errors on sponsored projects that need to be corrected, a cost transfer is necessary. The proper way to correct an error is through a cost transfer within 90 days of the initial charge (seeUniversity Policy 3.20, Cost Transfers on Sponsored Projects). Non-salary cost transfers can be done by journal entry using a KFS General Error Correction (GEC) e-doc. Salary cost transfers can be done by submitting a KFS Salary Expense Transfer (ST) e-doc and will be reviewed by Sponsored Financial Services (SFS). (https://policy.cornell.edu/policy-library/cost-transfers-sponsored-agreements)\nNon-salary cost transfers must be supported with auditable documentation. A detailed explanation as to why the error occurred and a detailed justification as to why the charge is valid for the account now being charged must be clearly stated.\nSalary cost corrections are made by submitting an ST e-doc. The form must be completed\u00a0 within an employee\u2019s certification period and submitted through KFS. Any salary cost corrections that appear to be late cost transfers will need additional review by SFS.\nCost Share\nSeeMonitoring Cost Sharing. (/resources/monitoring-cost-sharing-project)\nOverdrafts\nPrincipal investigators and unit administrators must see that a sponsored project is not overspent.\u00a0 An overdraft situation must be dealt with immediately after evaluating the cause of the over expenditure.\nOverdrafts occur for various reasons. The two most common situations include (1) units who do not monitor expense activity allow costs beyond the awarded amount, and (2) projects spanning more than one year do not receive the future-year funding in a timely manner to cover the allowable expenses for the continuing year.\nOne or more of the following is appropriate for corrections of overdrafts, keeping theCost Transfer policyin mind: (https://policy.cornell.edu/policy-library/cost-transfers-sponsored-agreements)\nSalary change by submitting an ST e-doc\nNon-salary cost transfer\nBudget modification with sponsor\u2019s notice of additional funding\nPer the Uniform Guidance (2 CFR 200.405(c)), \"Any cost allocable to a particular Federal award under the principles provided for in this part may not be charged to other Federal awards to overcome fund deficiencies, to avoid restrictions imposed by Federal statutes, regulations, or terms and conditions of the Federal awards, or for other reasons.\" (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/subtitle-A/chapter-II/part-200#p-200.405(c))\nBudget Modifications\nSeeBudget Revisions. (/resources/budget-revisions)\nProgram Income\nThe Uniform Guidance (2 CFR 200.1 Program income) states, \"Program income means gross income earned by the non-Federal entity that is directly generated by a supported activity or earned as a result of the Federal award during the period of performance....\" The sponsored project agreement will dictate how program income is to be treated. Generally, income is applied to the sponsored project and is used to offset expenses thus benefiting the sponsored project. Examples of program income include fees earned from services performed under the award; funds generated by sale of commodities and research materials such as tissue cultures, cell lines, or research animals; admission fees; or registration fees charged to participants for a workshop or conference sponsored by an award. (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/subtitle-A/chapter-II/part-200#p-200.1(Program%20income))\nFor more information, seeUniversity Policy 3.8 Program Income from Sponsored Projects. (https://policy.cornell.edu/policy-library/program-income-sponsored-projects)\nEquipment Transfers\nSeeEquipment Transfers. (/resources/equipment-transfers)\nNo Cost Extensions\nWhen it is evident that a project will not be completed on time, the sponsor must be informed in writing with a request for a time extension with no additional funds granted (no cost extension).\u00a0 This request must be made no later than 10 to 60 days before the end date of the project or as otherwise dictated in the award document. The sponsor will need to respond to the university in writing in order for the project to be extended.SFS will not extend a project without written notification. If no written notification is received before the report is due, a financial report will be sent to the sponsor under the original end date.\u00a0 Should a no-cost extension be received after the reporting period, the end date will be changed, and the project may continue.\nChange in Principal Investigator (PI) - Illness, Transfer, or Termination\nSeeChange in PI or Key Personnel and Effort.

Given that cost share generally comprises institutional funds, it\u2019s important to understand the risks and requirements related to managing this activity. (https://www.dfa.cornell.edu/policy/policies/cost-sharing-sponsored-agreements)\nFederal requirements are outlined in Title II of the Code of Federal Regulation, Part 200 - Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards. See Uniform Guidance (UG)2 CFR \u00a7200.306 Cost sharing or matching. (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/subtitle-A/chapter-II/part-200#200.306)\nGet Help. If you have questions on accounting for cost share,\u00a0contact the appropriateSource Accountantorsfs-help@cornell.edu (/resources/who-can-help-finance-staff, mailto:sfs-help@cornell.edu)\nTracking Cost Share\nStandard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Cost Share Sub-account (PDF, 865 KB) (https://www.dfa.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/cg-cost-share-sub-account.pdf)\nTo avoid complications well into the project, establish the required accounts/sub-accounts upon execution of the award and monitor them throughout the life of the agreement.\nCost Share Sub-Account\nA sub-account is required to track cost share commitments using institutional funds. Costs incurred and contributed to the match need to be posted to the cost share sub-account. Do not post them to the funding account (i.e., the account that is funding the cost sharing).\nAccount Attribute - Cost Share for Project Number\nAn account attribute is required to track cost share contributed by one sponsored agreement to another sponsored agreement. This is also used for cost share that is met by capital construction (i.e., a plant account). A separate project-related account consistent with the period of performance associated with the project necessitating the cost share may be required. For plant accounts, a separate sub-account may be used to manage the committed cost share related to the specific portion of a larger plant project.\nDo not use a cost share sub-account to track commitments between two separate sponsored agreements or capital construction. Refer toCost Share Sub-Accounts\u00a0(PDF, 865 KB). (https://www.dfa.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/cg-cost-share-sub-account.pdf)\nPre-Award Accounts\nBe cautious of lengthy negotiations and its impact on proposed commitments. Commitments can change over time and may need to be re-evaluated to ensure they can still be met, prior to executing the agreement.\nUncommitted Cost Share\nVoluntary uncommitted cost share is not required to be tracked and shouldnotbe recorded in a cost share sub-account. Effort that the unit wishes to track for other reporting purposes technically is not a component of the project that requires tracking and documentation. Therefore, these expenses are institutional and should be recorded appropriately based on institutional funds rather than in the cost base of the project.\nCoordinating Cost Share Across Collaborating Units/Departments\nExpenses Contributed by an Organization\nThe organization (org) contributing activity (i.e., expenses) may need a project-related account and cost share sub-account. Expenses incurred within an org generally must be tracked within that org. In addition, effort contributed by a specific org requires a costing allocation for staffing within that org. In other words, staffing must be allocated directly to that org\u2019s account/cost share sub-account.\nReporting access is derived from the fiscal officer, account manager, and the project\u2019s lead principal investigator. It\u2019s important that a project\u2019s accounting structure, including cost share sub-accounts be structured in a way that allows the individuals responsible for a specific portion of the project to have access to financial data required to provide such an oversight.\nFunding ($$) Contributed by an Organization\nIn some cases, an org may be contributing funds only. This can be addressed by an institutional transfer to the administrative org, and, in this case, the administrative org processes the transactions that are incurred within that org to address the commitment.\nMonitoring Commitments\nIt\u2019s important to monitor the cost share commitment throughout the life of the project. Failure to meet the cost share requirement may result in a loss of funding.\nProject Overrun (True Deficit)\nIf the project has incurred more expenses than awarded, the result is aproject overrun. A project overrun must remain in the same cost base as the project. For example, a research project must have the deficit recorded in a research account. A public service project must have the deficit recorded in a public service account.\nThe most appropriate mechanism for a project overrun is to record the deficit in a cost share sub-account as part of the closeout activity. By doing that, all costs automatically remain within the project\u2019s cost base. However, a departmental overrun account that is in the correct base may also be used.\nNational Institute of Health (NIH) Salary Cap\nEffort in excess of NIH\u2019s salary cap is unallowable toward a cost share commitment but does need to be tracked in a cost share sub-account.\nUnderstanding and Managing the NIH Salary Cap (PDF, 372 KB) (https://www.dfa.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/nih-salary-cap2015.pdf)\nFinancial Management (/compliance/financial-management)\nUkraine/Russia Transactions Guidance (/news/ukrainerussia-transactions-guidance)\nSalary Certification (/resources/salary-certification)\nMonitoring Project Expenditures (/resources/monitoring-project-expenditures)\nFinancial Reporting to Sponsors (/resources/financial-reporting-sponsors)\nDirect and Indirect Cost Examples (/resources/direct-and-indirect-cost-examples)\nDiverse Suppliers Requirements (/resources/diverse-suppliers-requirements)\nUse of Foreign Airlines on Federal Funds (/resources/use-foreign-airlines-federal-funds)\nFinancial Management of Sponsored Projects Policies and Procedures (/policies/financial-management-sponsored-projects-policies-and-procedures)\nQuick Reference\nRates (/rates)\nForms (/forms)\nPolicies (/policies)\nContacts (/contacts)\nTraining (/training)\nEvents (/events)\nNews & Announcements (/news)\n\u00a9 2019 Cornell University\nWeb Accessibility Help (mailto:rais-help@cornell.edu?subject=researchservices.cornell.edu%20site)"

This information can usually be found in the \"Eligibility\" section of a funding opportunity announcement. These opportunities are referred to as \"limited submissions\".\nLimited submission opportunities\u00a0undergo an internal review and selection process, which is managed by the Research Development team in Cornell Research & Innovation. It is necessary to manage limited submission opportunities for several reasons, including a sponsor may decline without review all Cornell submissions if they receive submissions in excess of the limit.\nNote: Some funding opportunities may also limit an organization's participation as a non-lead partner or subawardee in a proposal. For example, the National Science Foundation has several limited submission funding opportunities where participating as a subawardee on another organization's proposal counts against Cornell's submission limit.\n\nIf you have questions or are considering applying to a limited submission solicitation/program not listed on this webpage, please contactCornell Limited Submissions.

(mailto:flm4001@med.cornell.edu)\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nHow are limited submissions managed? What is the internal process?\nUnless otherwise stated in an internal call, application materials must be submitted via the online competition portal (InfoReady) by\u00a05:00 PM ET on the due date.\u00a0If you experience technical issues with InfoReady, please contact Limited Submissions immediately.If the competition deadline has just passed, all your internal application materials should also be attached to the email.\u00a0We will respond to you during regular business hours.To avoid missing a submission deadline, login and submit early.Late internal submissions are rarely accepted.\nGeneral Process\nInternal Competition\nFor most limited submissions, prospective applicants/nominees must first apply to an internal competition. Each internal competition call includes a submission deadline, summary of the opportunity, link and/or pdf file for the sponsor's program guidelines, and a list of materials required for the internal review process.\nApplicants typically must provide a list of all Key Personnel, a 2-3 page project description, and a biosketch/CV for the lead PI.\u00a0Some competitions require additional materials, such as a\u00a0letter of nomination from a Department Chair\u00a0or an estimated budget outline.\u00a0Internal application\u00a0requirements vary depending on the program.\nUnless otherwise noted in an internal call, applications must be submitted viaCornell's web-based internal competition platform(InfoReady).\u00a0First-time users will\u00a0need to set-up an InfoReady account before submitting an application. (https://cornell.infoready4.com/#osp)\nIt is the PI's responsibility to ensure they meet a sponsor's guidelines and eligibility requirements, and follow the internal submission instructions and\u00a0submit by the specified due date.\u00a0Requests for deadline extensions for internal competitions are rarely granted.\nInternal Review and Selection\nFor STEM opportunities, the Faculty Senate's Research Advisory Committee (RAC)\u00a0reviews internal applications for limited submissions. The RAC selects to move forward\u00a0the submission(s) that has the best opportunity for success based on its responsiveness to the sponsor's program objectives and selection criteria, and scientific and scholarly strength.\nFor Humanities and Social Sciences opportunities,\u00a0ad hoc review panels are\u00a0convened.\nFor\u00a0opportunities where the submission limit is on the number of applicants per individual department (e.g., Sloan Research Fellowships), the\u00a0internal selection is coordinated by departments or colleges rather than OVPRI. This information is included in the announcements that are disseminated to campus.\nFor some competitions, Deans and/or other senior leadership may participate in an internal review.\nAfter Internal Review and Selection\nApplicants are promptly notified of the internal review outcome, which typically includes a summary of reviewers' feedback.\nThe applicant selected to advance is also given detailed information for next steps in submitting to the sponsor, and works with their unit research administrator and assigned Grant & Contract Officer (GCO) to submit a full proposal packet, according to each sponsor's specific instructions and guidelines.Note: Materials submitted for the internal review/selection process are usually not the same as what a funder requires.\n\"Shortfuse\" Limited Submissions and Expedited Review\nWhile we strive to provide ample preparation time to applicants for internal competitions, sometimes\u00a0a sponsor\u2019s proposal submission timeline necessitates a short internal timeline. For these \"short fuse\" opportunities there is\u00a0expedited internal review and selection process wherein prospective applicants have a short time (usually 3 to 7 days) to submit an internal Letter of Interest or similar. The internal call for a \"short fuse\" limited submission will provide specific instructions. In some rare circumstances,\u00a0a sponsor's timeline may be so short that it precludes an internal review altogether, and an applicant may be approved to submit to the sponsor on a\"first come, first serve\" basis.\nInstitutionally Coordinated Submissions\nFor limited submissions that are high-priority funding opportunities for the University, senior leadership may coordinate a Cornell application submission. In these cases, there may not be internal competition.\nResearch Advisory Committee (RAC) Membership\n\nWhere do I find information about limited submissions and internal competitions?\nTo receive timely communications about limited submission opportunities,subscribe to the CU-RES-ADMIN-L listserv here. (https://researchservices.cornell.edu/resources/research-mailing-lists-list-servs)\nLimited submissions are regularly announced via our listserv (weekly Limited Submissions email digest and in stand-alone internal competition calls), and on this website. Most open internal competitions are also listed onCornell's web-based internal competition platform(InfoReady). Due to the expedited review process, \"short fuse\" limited submissions are not listed on InfoReady. (https://cornell.infoready4.com/#osp)\n\nWhat should I do if a limited submission opportunity is not posted here or to the Cornell InfoReady website?\nIf faculty, students, or staff become aware of a limited submission opportunity that is not currently listed on this webpage or theCornell InfoReady website, they shouldnotify Limited Submissionsbefore anything is submitted to the sponsor. (https://cornell.infoready4.com/#osp, mailto:ovpr_limited_submissions@cornell.edu)\nWe do our best to identify and announce limited submission opportunities, but cannot guarantee that we find them all.If there is any question about submission limits for a solicitation, please contact us.\nI want to resubmit to a sponsor's limited submission funding opportunity. Do I need to get approval from Cornell?\nIf you submitted to a sponsor's previous cycle for a limited submission program but were declined funding and would like to resubmit, you mustcontact OVPRI Limited Submissionsbefore reapplying. (mailto:ovpr_limited_submissions@cornell.edu)\nResubmissions almost always count against Cornell's submission limit. Even if a sponsor's program officer encourages you to resubmit, you must get approval from Cornell before doing so. If there is an active internal competition for the funder's current submission cycle, you will need to participate in the internal competition.\nThe internal submission deadline has passed and I'm interested in applying to the funding opportunity. Who should I contact?\nIf you missed an internal submission deadline, you are welcome to contact Limited Submissions to learn if the opportunity is still \"open\" (i.e., if there are application slots available). If the submission slot(s) was not already filled, you may still be able to apply to the funding opportunity. In these situations, approvals to submit to the funder are typically granted on a first-come, first-served basis.\nWhere can I get help using the InfoReady competition platform?\nEmail Cornell Limited Submissionsif you need help or experience technical issues with the InfoReady application platform. We strongly recommend logging into the system early, so any potential technical issues can be addressed before the submission deadline.If you have technical issues when submitting your application, email us immediately and with your application materials attached. We will respond during regular business hours. (mailto:ovpr_limited_submissions@cornell.edu)\nWhat should I do if I was selected to be a Cornell candidate but decide not to submit?\nIf a selected candidate decides not to submit to the sponsor, they mustnotify Cornell Limited Submissionsas soon as possible. Internal competitions are highly competitive and, where possible, we want to allow another applicant to be selected to submit. (mailto:ovpr_limited_submissions@cornell.edu)\nWhat are some tips for preparing competitive applications for internal competitions?\nRead the solicitation and research the sponsor. What is the sponsor's mission? What and who does it aim to fund? Make sure you are eligible to be considered. Align your proposal with the program goals and priorities. Don't simply recycle internal proposals from\u00a0different competitions - bethoughtful and specific to the funding opportunity.\nThe internal proposal should be accessible to a broad scientific audience. Members of the internal review panel will have differing levels of familiarity with your specific area of research.\u00a0Define significant technical terms and avoid using\u00a0\"jargon.\" Clearly state the problem/need that your proposed project will address. Clearly describe the project objectives, methods, innovation, and impact. Clearly describe the \"big picture.\"\u00a0If you succeed, what difference will it make? What will be the impact?\nRead and adhere to all the internal submission requirements, including content and page limits. Proofread and check for typos.\nIf a letter of nomination is required for the\u00a0internal submission, it should\u00a0be specific to the funding opportunity/program.\nThe Cornell Research Advisory Committee (RAC) has developed recommendations for Chairs writing nomination letters for internal competitions for external funding. These can be downloaded as a pdf file:Tips for writing letters of nominations(a Cornell netID login is required for access). (https://researchservices.cornell.edu/system/files/protected-document/2021-09/RAC%20Tips%20for%20Chair%20Nomination%20Letters.pdf)\nI am an investigator from Weill Cornell Medicine. How do I apply to limited submission competitions?\nWeill Cornell Medicine has its own internal competitions for limited submission funding opportunities. If you are an investigator from WCM, contactFlorencia Marcucciin the Office of the Research Dean. Do not apply to competitions listed on this website or InfoReady.

For more information about Cornell IRB training requirements, visit theIRB Training webpage. (/news/nih-policy-change-new-data-management-and-sharing-policy, /news/irb-news-new-training-requirement-exempt-research, /resources/irb-training)\nInformed consent is more than just a form; it is a process that takes place between researcher and participant, forming the basis of ethical research that respects the autonomy of research subjects.\nIntroduction to Informed Consent\nInformed consent is one of the most important aspects of conducting ethical research with human participants. Respecting the autonomy of research participants, the investigator must provide complete and true information regarding the study. The \"informed\" in informed consent means the participant has all the information necessary to make a decision. To help new researchers develop a consent process that works, the IRB staff offers abrief video tutorialon the basics of informed consent. (https://vod.video.cornell.edu/media/Informed+Consent+101/1_i0zhhdsa)\nThe principle of informed consent applies to ALL types of research including surveys, interviews, and observations in which participants are identified, and other experiments, such as diet, drug and exercise studies.\nTypically, a \"consent form\" documents that the informed consent process has taken place. It must contain all the required components of informed consent, as defined in45 CFR 46.116, and described below. The consent form must be written in language that is easy for the participant to understand. Avoid technical terms and complex sentences, regardless of your intended audience. When there are different groups or types of participants who may take part in a study, different consent documents may be required for different study populations. (https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=ee8b67c9af1359a82e122a6dfba0813c&mc=true&node=se45.1.46_1116&rgn=div8)\nInformed Consent Can Take Various Forms\nSigned informed consentis the gold standard, and what is generally required for research with human participants. This involves presentation of a written document to the prospective participant, including all elements of informed consent. The document is read and signed by the participant and kept as a record by the researcher.\nRemember: if you choose a written informed consent process, the research will not be anonymous.\u00a0 Do not promise anonymity to prospective participants and then ask them to sign a consent form!\nImplied consentis the tacit indication that a person has knowingly agreed to participate in research by performing a research activity or task. This type of consent process is most common in internet-based research. Participants must still be presented with the consent information - the information a participants needs to know in order to make an educated decision about whether or not to participate. This type of process is be considered a waiver of documentation of informed consent, and must meet certain requirements to be applied to a given study (seeIRB SOP #10). (/policies/irb-policy-10-informed-consent-options-processes-and-documentation)\nOral consentoccurs when the researcher reads a consent script, and the subject verbally indicates that they agree to participate. Subjects should be given the opportunity to ask questions and, in most cases, provided with an information sheet containing key information about the study, including contact information for the PI. SeeIRB SOP #10for more details on how to implement and document an oral consent procedure. (/policies/irb-policy-10-informed-consent-options-processes-and-documentation)\nInresearch with children, a parent or guardian must typically give their permission (called \"parental consent\") to allow the child to participate. Also, if the child is mature enough, they will need to give their \"assent\" to participate. For detailed information, please read the IRB'sguidance document on Research Involving Children. (/policies/irb-policy-11-research-involving-children)\nGuidelines for Writing your Informed Consent Document\nGeneral advice:\nStart with an IRB-approvedconsent form template. (/forms/irb-consent-form-templates)\nHeadings for paragraphs are helpful and make the form easier to read.\nUse adequate white space so that the form is easy to read. Avoid fine print.\n1. Provide a clear, concise explanation of the purposes of the research including the name of the study (the IRB can waive under certain specific circumstances if appropriate).\nReplace any technical terms with ordinary language, and use simple, clear phrasing. Avoid unnecessarily long or wordy paragraphs.\n2. Explain what will be happening to the participant during the study and indicate participant's time commitment for each component.\nBe clear about what the participant will be asked to do, not vaguely say, \"You might be asked to,\" state \"You will be asked.\" \u00a0The participant needs to understand what the experiment involves in order to decide whether they want to participate.\nWrite in the second person \"You\" -- for example: \"You are invited to participate in a research project..., \" \"You will be asked to...\"\nDo not make coercive statements such as \"you understand that ...,\" \"you have been told that...\n3. Describe the frequent and/or important risks, side effects or discomforts of the study procedures (e.g., even though it is not considered a risky procedure, a needle stick to draw blood creates discomfort).\nIf it appears that there are no real risks to participation, state, \"We do not anticipate any risks to you participating other than those encountered in daily life.\" See ourSample Consent Form. (/forms/irb-consent-form-templates)\n4. Describe any direct or indirect benefit from participating.\nLearning about how experiments are conducted, receiving a gift, or earning extra credit for being a research participant are NOT direct benefits. Gifts and extra credit are considered compensation or incentives.\nLearning about how research is conducted, gaining some knowledge of a particular subject, or enjoying a game played during the research, may be indirect benefits.\n5. State that the participant's involvement is voluntary, the participant may refuse to participate before the study begins, discontinue at any time, or skip any questions that may make him/her feel uncomfortable, with no penalty to him/her, and no effect on the compensation earned before withdrawing, or academic standing or record.\nIf completing the entire study is required for compensation, make this clear. Likewise, if there are minimum requirements to be met to earn compensation, state this clearly.\nIf partial compensation or pro-rated compensation will be given, please make clear how the amount of compensation will be determined.\n6. State that the participant is allowed to ask questions concerning the study, both before agreeing to be involved and during the course of the study. See required contact information in #11 below.\n7. Describe how participant's confidentiality will be protected.\n8.\u00a0Describe what will be done with the data once the study is completed, including identifiable information.\nInclude any plans to share either identifiable or de-identified data with other researchers, or to publish in journals or present at conferences.\n9.\u00a0Indicate that recording devices, audio or visual, are being used (when applicable).\nIf identifiable images or videos will be used for any purpose other than analysis of data, please make this clear and make sure the participant indicates permission for these uses (see below).\nDescribe what will be done with the any video or audio tapes upon the completion of the study (destroyed, erased, archived, etc.), and when (after transcription,3 years, 5 years, etc.).\nIf being audio/video recorded is required to participate in the study, please make this clear on the consent form. Whether this is required is up to the PI, but if so it should be clear for the participant.\nIf recording is optional, provide a separate signature line on the consent form for the participant to agree to be video/audio taped or photographed. For example:\nPlease sign below if you are willing to have this interview recorded on tape (specify audio or video).You may still participate in this study if you are not willing to have the interview recorded.I am willing to have this interview recorded on tape:Signed: ______________ Date: __________\n10. Indicate that the participant shall receive a copy of the signed and dated consent form.\n11. Provide the name(s) of the investigator(s) and contact information.\n12. Indicate that the participant may contact the Institutional Review Board (IRB) with any concerns or complaints.\nInclude our email address (irbhp@cornell.edu), phone (607-255- 5138), andwebsite. (/offices/IRB)\nConcerns may also be reported anonymous through EthicsPoint online atwww.hotline.cornell.eduor by calling toll free 1-866-293-3077. Ethicspoint is an independent organization that serves as a liaison between the University and the person bringing the complaint so that anonymity can be ensured. (http://www.hotline.cornell.edu)\n13. Include at the bottom of the form:\u00a0\"This consent form will be kept by the researcher for at least three years beyond the end of the study and was approved by the IRB on [date].\"\nRemember, if the participant is under the age of 18, parental/guardian consent is required. This includes college and university students under the age of 18, unless the IRB approves a request for waiver of parental consent (at their discretion). If the participant is 7-17 years old, child assent is also required.\nResearch Involving Deception\nYou will need to explain the deception and the reason for it to the participant as soon as the study is completed.Deception (including incomplete disclosure) is a technique that is sometimes used in social and behavioral research, in order to avoid response bias or for other valid scientific reasons. However, deception conflicts the subject's ability to make a fully informed decision about whether or not to participate in the research. To mitigate this concern,debriefing is an essential part of the consent process whenever a study involves deception.\nOnce a participant has been debriefed, it is almost always appropriate to offer them the opportunity to withdraw their consent to participate.A template for creating a debrief can be found here:Sample Debriefing Statement.

NIH-fundedClinical Trialsalso require Good Clinical Practice (GCP) training for all study personnel. (/resources/irb-considerations-clinical-trials)\nACCESSING REQUIRED TRAINING\nWhere do I complete required trainings?\nCornell subscribes to the online program delivered by theCollaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI)to provide relevant courses in research ethics. (https://about.citiprogram.org/)\nHow do I access CITI as a Cornell faculty, staff, or student?\nYou can log into CITI via theCornell Single Sign On (SSO), and can follow ourGuide to Accessing CITI Training for Cornell Researchersfor more detailed directions on accessing and beginning CITI training. (http://www.oria.cornell.edu/training/citi/login/index.cfm, /sites/default/files/2022-09/Guide%20to%20Accessing%20CITI%20Training%20for%20Cornell%20Researchers.pdf)\nI am not affiliated with Cornell, but am listed as study personnel on a Cornell IRB Protocol. How do I access the required training?\nIf you are not affiliated with Cornell but you are listed as a research team on an IRB protocol, you will either need to take Cornell's CITI IRB training or provide proof of equivalent training. To take the Cornell CITI training, you can access the CITI Program website viacitiprogram.org, register to create an account, and then add an \"Affiliation\" with Cornell University. You can then take the IRB/Human Subjects Research training provided by Cornell. Follow ourGuide to Accessing CITI Training for Cornell Researchersfor more detailed directions on accessing and beginning CITI training. (https://about.citiprogram.org/, /sites/default/files/2022-09/Guide%20to%20Accessing%20CITI%20Training%20for%20Cornell%20Researchers.pdf)\nHow do I know if I - or others on my protocol - have already completed required training?\nResearchers can checkCourse Completion Records(updated every 60 minutes) to ensure personnel listed on their protocols have completed the required training through CITI. You can also log into your CITI account and access your course history in the 'My Records' tab at the top of the page. (https://irb.cornell.edu/lookup/index.cfm)\nIf neither of those methods work, you can reach out to irbhp@cornell.edu and our staff can assist you.\nIRB TRAINING IN CITI\nHow do I know if I should take the IRB training?\nAll research team members named on a Cornell IRB protocol must complete online human participant research training. This training requirement has been in place for expedited and full board IRB protocols for a number of years, but as of October 1, 2022, this applies to protocols determined to be exempt, as well. The training needs to be completed every five (5) years, and a refresher is available 90 days before the due date.\nThe Cornell IRB runs training via the CITI program - which can beaccessed here. You can follow theGuide to Accessing CITI Trainingto get started. (/training/citi-online-courses-cornell-researchers-coi-irb-rcr-export-control, /sites/default/files/2022-09/Guide%20to%20Accessing%20CITI%20Training%20for%20Cornell%20Researchers.pdf)\nWhich CITI course should I take to complete the IRB training requirement?\nThe training is simply called 'IRB Training.' We previously offered courses with different names, focused on different fields, but have combined them into the singular course with the essential information. If you take 'IRB Basic' or 'IRB - BioMedical Research', those trainings will also be accepted.\nWhat is the content of the IRB training?\nThe IRB Training course consists of eight (8) modules on various research ethics topics such as the conflicts of interest, history and ethical principles, informed consent, privacy and confidentiality, and doing research with vulnerable populations. The course material is made of text and still images with each module followed by a short quiz. The training does not need to be done all in one sitting.\nHow well do I need to do on the IRB course to complete the requirement?\nYou need to receive an 80% or higher on the course to fulfill the IRB Training requirement.\nI took an IRB/research ethics course through a different institution within the last five years. Do I still need to take the Cornell training?\nIt depends on how comparable this previous institution\u2019s training is to Cornell University\u2019s training. The Cornell IRB staff can review your course record or completion report to ensure that all required topics are covered to the rigor that we expect. If they decide that your previous course is not comparable to the Cornell IRB training, they will require you to take Cornell\u2019s.\nYou can submit these separate institutions\u2019 previous records via your RASS-IRB protocol (under Additional Documents > Training Documentation (from non-Cornell sources)) or send it toirbhp@cornell.eduso that a member of the IRB staff can review it. (mailto:irbhp@cornell.edu)\nGOOD CLINICAL PRACTICE (GCP) TRAINING\nHow do I know if I should take the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) training?\nUnder National Institutes of Health (NIH) requirements that became effective January 1, 2017, all personnel involved in the design, conduct, oversight, or management of an NIH clinical trial must also be trained in Good Clinical Practice (GCP).\nWhat CITI course do I take to complete the GCP training requirement?\nWe have multiple courses in CITI that would fulfill the GCP requirement:\nGCP \u2013 Social and Behavioral Research Best Practices for Clinical Research\nGCP for Clinical Trials with Investigational Drugs and Medical Devices (U.S. FDA Focus)\nGCP for Clinical Investigations of Devices\nGCP for Clinical Trials with Investigational Drugs and Biologics\nYou should choose the one that best resembles the research you are conducting.\nHow often do I need to take GCP training?\nPersonnel listed on any NIH clinical trials need to have completed GCP trainingwithin the previous three (3) years.\nI took GCP training from a different institution within the last 3 years. Do I still need to take the Cornell training?\nIt depends. NIH does not specify any particular GCP course to fulfill the requirements. Cornell researchers may complete GCP training online through CITI, or discuss other options with the IRB office.\nALTERNATIVES TO CITI TRAINING\nThe IRB understands that researchers working in the field often hire local enumerators or researchers to collect data for their studies. Since these individuals are often \"engaged\" in human participant research, the federal training requirements apply. Depending upon level of education, language, and web access, online CITI training may not be appropriate as a training mechanism for these data collectors.\nField Training Guides\nJohn Hopkins offersfield training guides(in various languages) in human participant research ethics. These guides are intended for a PI or co-investigator to use in the training of study team members who will (1) obtain informed consent from research participants, or (2) collect data from human subjects (e.g. enumerators). These can be used for in-person (or Zoom) trainings, and may be more appropriate than the online CITI program IRB training when language or internet access is a barrier. (https://publichealth.jhu.edu/offices-and-services/institutional-review-board-irb/training/human-subjects-research-ethics-field-training-guide)\nContactIRB staffto discuss appropriate alternatives to CITI IRB training for these types of cases. (https://researchservices.cornell.edu/offices/IRB)\nAdditional Research Trainings\nTheCenter for Cultural Humilityprovides a variety of research trainings based off of the principles of anti-racism and Community-Based Participatory Research. Their services include an Equitable Research Design Training, Citizen Science Training, and Community Partner Matching. While these trainings are not required for IRB protocols, we encourage researchers to consider signing up. (https://humility.cornell.edu/)\nWeill Cornell IRB Training Requirements\nThe Cornell Ithaca campus and Weill Cornell Medical campus have separate IRBs and different training requirements.

Cornell University fits this criterion and as such is required to implement a research security program.\nWhat is the purpose of NSPM-33?\nThe White House Office of Science Technology and Policy (OSTP) has stated three primary purposes:\nto protect America\u2019s security and openness;\nto be clear so that well-intentioned researchers can easily and properly comply; and\nto ensure that policies do not fuel xenophobia or prejudice.\nWhen does Cornell need to comply?\nOSTP has been directed through the National Science and Technology Council to develop the implementation guidance with the goal of providing clear and effective rules for ensuring research security and researcher responsibilities.Research organizations will have one year from release of the OSTP guidance to fully implement their research security programs.\nHow is Cornell preparing?\nCornell is fully committed to timely and complete compliance with NSPM-33. We are closely monitoring the regulatory requirements and preparing for the anticipated OSTP guidance. We are conducting broad outreach, so that researchers understand what will be required of them.\nWhere can I read more about NSPM-33?\nNSPM-33 (https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-memorandum-united-states-government-supported-research-development-national-security-policy/)\nNSPM-33 Implementation Guidance (https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/010422-NSPM-33-Implementation-Guidance.pdf)\nOSTP Draft Requirements (https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/RS_Programs_Guidance_public_comment.pdf)\nWho can I contact with questions?

Which IRB (or IRBs) should complete an ethical and regulatory review depends on several factors, including: funding agency requirements, the level of IRB oversight needed based on potential risk to participants; the nature of human participant research to be conducted by each institution; and which other institution(s) IRBs are involved, and what their internal processes and policies require in such cases.\nNote: Before you begin the process of seeking IRB approval for multi-site or collaborative research, contact theIRB officeto discuss your situation and find the best solution from the options described below. It is possible that not all collaborators are considered investigators from an IRB perspective, in which case multiple IRB review or a reliance agreement may not be necessary. (mailto: irb-reliance@cornell.edu)\nOption 1: Separate/Multiple IRBs Review\nIn some cases, it is most efficient for researchers from each participating institution to obtain IRB approval from their own institution's IRB, covering any regulated human participant activities that will occur at their site. This will almost always be the case when research is eligible for exemption from IRB review.\nOption 2: \u00a0One IRB Reviews (aka \"Single IRB\" or sIRB)\nIn some situations, to avoid duplicative reviews and increase efficiencies--or to comply with federal regulations--the Cornell IRB might agree to serve as the \"IRB of Record\" or cede IRB review to another institution. The IRB of Record--sometimes called the \"Single IRB\" or sIRB--is selected on a study-by-study basis, provides the ethical review and related administrative coordination for all sites/institutions participating in a collaborative or multi-site study, and assumes responsibility for all human participant research compliance. The IRB of Recordis usually chosen from among participating institutions, but may be provided by an external, commercial provider of IRB services (e.g.,BRANY). The IRB at each participating site will need to formally cede their IRB review to the reviewing IRB using a fully-executed reliance agreement (sometimes called an IRB authorization agreement or IAA). (https://www.brany.com/irb-services/)\nMore Information about sIRB Review\nUnder the revised (2018) Common Rule, federally-funded multi-institution studies--with very few exceptions--are required to use an sIRBfor review and approval of cooperative studies conducted in the United States. This applies to all cooperative research applications and contract proposals submitted on or after January 20, 2020.\nForNIH studies, a version of the sIRB requirement has been in effect since January 2018. For applications submitted on or after January 25, 2018, NIH-funded multi-site studies involving non-exempt research must use ansIRB, when the same protocol is used at multiple domestic study sites. (https://grants.nih.gov/policy/humansubjects/single-irb-policy-multi-site-research.htm, https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-16-094.html)\nThe Cornell IRB is not always equipped to serve as the sIRB, depending upon the specifics of the research. Researchers should contact theCornell IRB officeprior to submitting a proposal to NIH or any other federal agency for a multi-site project. The IRB staff will assist PIs with identifying a suitable partner to act as the sIRB, if Cornell is unable to serve in that capacity. (/offices/IRB)\nFAQs\nWhat exactly is collaborative/multi-site research?\nCollaborative research- when non-Cornell investigators come to Cornell to work on a Cornell study, or conduct a separate aspect of the study (such as data analysis) elsewhere.\nMulti-site research- when Cornell is one of many participating sites, with each site recruiting and consenting subjects and collecting data.\nWhat is a Reliance (Authorization) Agreement?\nAn IRB Reliance Agreement is a document permitting one institution's IRB to cede review (the \u201cRelying IRB\u201d) to another institution's IRB (the \u201cIRB of Record\u201d) for a particular study involving human participants. In this way, only one IRB reviews and approves human subject research activities for both institutions, avoiding duplicative review and regulatory oversight.\nHow do I obtain a reliance agreement for my Cornell research project?\nIf you believe a reliance agreement makes sense for a study that you are involved in, and your co-investigators from the other institution(s) agree, we recommend that you first schedule a call withIRB staffto confirm that your proposed approach will work. (/offices/IRB)\nOnce you have confirmed that a reliance agreement is needed, you can indicate if you want Cornell to serve as the IRB of Record, or if you want Cornell to rely on another IRB, within the protocol application inRASS-IRB. See theRASS Guide Sitefor instructions on how to do this. (https://rass.cornell.edu/irb, https://guide.rass.cornell.edu/)\nIf a reliance agreement is appropriate (or required by the sponsor), IRB staff will work with the other institution's IRB to negotiate and execute the agreement.\nWhat about Ithaca and Weill human subjects research collaborations?\nCornell University (CU) includes both the Ithaca-based campuses (Ithaca, Geneva and Cornell Tech campus) and the Weill Cornell Medicine Campus (\u201cWCM\u201d). The campuses operate separate IRBs and maintain separate Federal Wide Assurances (FWAs) with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, so an umbrella reliance agreement has been put in place between the IRBs to facilitate the timely, streamlined review of research collaborations spanning the campuses.\nWhen a CU investigator from the Ithaca or Tech campuses is engaged in human subject research under the oversight of Weill Cornell Medicine, the CU investigatormustinitiate a request for IRB reliance through the CU IRB Protocol Management System(RASS-IRB) - see thishow-to guidefor instructions.It is recommendedtoreach out to our officebefore you begin this process.

If the other institution is collecting datafor your project, they would be considered \"engaged\" in the research under federal regulations, and IRB review will be needed for their role on the project (either by their home IRB or by the Cornell IRB). If the other institution is only providing data or access to data that has already been collected, IRB review will not be needed for this aspect of the study. Instead, a Data Use Agreement should be entered into, in consultation withOSP. (/offices/osp)\nWhat training is needed?\nWhen Cornell is acting as the Reviewing IRB,Cornell's training requirementsapply. \u00a0Likewise, if another institution is reviewing your project, you will need to comply with that institution's training requirements. Note that Weill and Cornell's Ithaca campuses have different training requirements; If Weill is providing IRB review for your study, you will need to complete training in Good Clinical Practices in addition to human subjects training. (/resources/irb-training)\nWhich institution(s) conduct ancillary reviews?\nWhen Cornell cedes IRB review to another institution's IRB, the Cornell PI is still responsible for ensuring compliance at their site, including appropriate submission and completion of any ancillary reviews such asCOI,EHSandIBC.

(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuTvmXJgCoc)\nPrinciples for NSF Broader Impacts Design\nGetting Started: Construct a Credible Impact Identity\nIdentify where your field intersects with societal needs, challenges, and opportunities.\nWhich societal needs and issuesmostconnect to your research? Which societal issues are most important to you, or the future of your field? Reflect on where exactly you can see yourself having societal impact, and remember that these activities can expand and develop over the course of many NSF-funded projects.\u00a0 Dream big, but start with a realistic plan over the next three to five years that can launch you towards realizing larger societal impacts goals over time.\nCompelling Broader Impacts plans build on past experiences, genuine interests, and the networks and contexts unique to each researcher.\u00a0 Integrate these components into your plan.\nStructure each proposal in a way that sets yourself up to connect your research and education aims with societal needs over the course of your NSF-supported research career.\nBe Strategic\nUnderstand and articulate how your Broader Impacts plan advances NSF's vision for the Broader Impacts of Research (see NSF Strategic Plan and Broadening Participation and Diversity in the Resources section below.)\nThink carefully about the goals of your Broader Impacts plan. Make sure you have short-term and long-term goals, and a pathway of resources, activities, and partners that connect them. Prioritize your efforts and time around specific goals that can be tracked and measured.\nBroader Impacts is not simply a list of unrelated, or random outreach activities. Focus on a plan that is rooted in societal needs and interests and use data/literature to demonstrate the need for your Broader Impacts plan.\nYou don\u2019t have to reinvent the wheel for your Broader Impacts plan to be innovative. In fact many of the best plans leverage, expand, or reimagine, a variety of existing resources on campus and in the community (contact us about our \u2018NSF-ready\u2019 community partners).\nBroadening participation of members of underrepresented groups in STEM is an NSF priority.\nDemonstrate Expertise\nBuild on best practices. If you want to work with young people in out-of school settings, what are the best practices for doing so? If you decide to focus on STEM teacher development, what is currently known to be the most effective approach?\u00a0 If you decide to focus on public science communication, what are the best methods and platforms for scientists that use this approach, how do you reach public audiences, and how do you measure the impact?\nReference the literature (ie. STEM education, scientific literacy, diversity in STEM, workforce needs) and NSF data ( i.e. NSF Science and Engineering Indicators) to show how your Broader Impacts plan is relevant. Identify the key societal issues you will address, and the evidence-based methods you will use. Approach this plan as you would a scientific research problem, with literature cited, research questions, methods, and a plan to share results.\nAre there particular skills, knowledge, or experiences that would enable you to do this work with more insight and credibility? Consider workshops, seed grants, and fellowships for faculty with the Cornell Institute for Teaching Innovation, Diversity and Inclusion, or Community Engagement.\nJoin forces with outside experts to ensure that your plan will be successful.\u00a0 In doing so, think about the opportunities and resources that are already at Cornell, in the community, or in your wider professional network.\nEstablish Meaningful Partnerships\nLeverage your network or local\u00a0community partners to strengthen your efforts, effectiveness, and access to the public. Science museums, public media, public service or public health center, youth programs, and professional societies are all potential partners for Broader Impacts.\u00a0 Peers and public-facing offices in your department and across campus can be resources and partners. *Contactresearch_development@cornell.edufor community partner ideas and contact information. (mailto:research_development@cornell.edu)\nEstablish good relationships with Broader Impacts partners. Nurture partnerships and keep them current, even when grant deadlines are not looming. Ensure that your partners' expertise, needs, and aims align with your interests so that everyone benefits from the partnership.\nCommunity-based partnerships can often help researchers to directly broaden participation of members of underrepresented groups in ways that that might not be possible on your own.\nPartners may have capacity and expertise in program evaluation.\nAllocate Adequate Resources and a Budget for your Partners\nMost broader Impacts plans require a variety of resources to have an impact.\nAllocating a realistic budget for broader impacts shows commitment to the work and credibility in a way that plans without such budgets do not.\nLike research partners, community partners often require budgets and resources for these projects. Demonstrate that you value the partner's contributions and expertise by budgeting for their time and involvement.\nBe sure to discuss with your partner how much they will need to complete the work outlined.\nIntegrate Research, Education, and Broader Impacts Aims\nInclude your trainees (undergraduate through postdoctoral) in the Broader Impacts plan; make a case for how their participation in the activities can support their professional development.\nDemonstrate Impacts and Share your Success\nInclude a plan to evaluate and refine your efforts and demonstrate impact over time. This is only possible with clear and measurable project goals.\nUtilize campus resources and internal and external consultants to assist you in developing an evaluation plan.\nShare successes and generalizable outcomes with public and professional networks.\u00a0 Connect with university and departmental communications staff. Keep your program office informed.\n\n\nJoin theCU-RES-Admin email listservto learn about upcoming Broader Impacts Identity and Design Workshops for faculty.

It is addressed to Principal Investigators (PIs) but can provide guidance for anybody involved in the human participant research process.\nWhile specific websites and resources will be linked where appropriate, a few central resources are:\nirbhp@cornell.edu\u2013 the e-mail address for the Institutional Review Board team. (mailto:irbhp@cornell.edu)\nMicrosoft Bookings\u2013 the page to make an appointment with IRB Administrators or RASS-IRB support.

(https://guide.rass.cornell.edu/institutional-review-board-for-human-participant-research)\nIRB Guidance and Policies\u2013 a page on the IRB website listing all guidance and policies regarding human participant research projects at Cornell University. (https://researchservices.cornell.edu/resources/irb-guidance-and-resources)\nStep 1: Determine whether or not your project requires a submission to the IRB.\nNot every project involving human information or biospecimens needs IRB oversight - the IRB only has oversight over activities that meet the regulatory definition of \u2018human subjects research.\u2019 Thisguidance documentis a decision tree that leads you through the many factors that determine whether or not a particular activity requires IRB review - but if you have any questions about it, or if you would like to confirm the decision, you can reach out to our office atirbhp@cornell.eduor make an appointment to meet with an IRB Administrator. For a more detailed overview of this topic, you can read throughPolicy 1. (https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/45-cfr-46/revised-common-rule-regulatory-text/index.html#46.102, https://researchservices.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/2019-05/IRB%20Decision%20Tree.pdf, mailto:irbhp@cornell.edu, /policies/irb-policy-1-determining-whether-research-activity-needs-irb-review-and-approval)\nStep 2: Prepare your protocol.\nIf you have determined that your project meets the definition of human subjects research, you should prepare the materials needed for your IRB protocol. These materials are dependent on your research protocol, but we will be looking for:\nThe full text of anydata collection instruments(ex. surveys, interview questions, stimuli, other forms or documents utilized with human participants) included in your research. You can make changes to these documents after the protocol is approved, but will need to submit an amendment and have it approved before any changes can be instituted in your protocol.\nInformed consentforms (We havetemplatesavailable.) (/forms/irb-consent-form-templates)\nRecruitment materials(How will participants be finding out about your research? We will want to see any posters/e-mails/social media posts that you will be using to advertise your study. For more information about what information is required in recruitment materials, you can look atPolicy 9.) (/policies/irb-policy-9-recruitment-and-payment-human-research-participants)\nThe human subject research ethicstraining recordsof everybody on your research team, including yourself. (People with Cornell NetIDs who have taken a Cornell IRB course through the online CITI Program will have their training automatically synched with the RASS-IRB system. Otherwise, you should upload the Training Completion Reports to the protocol. For more information about our training requirements, please visit theIRB Trainingpage.) (/resources/irb-training)\nAnything else providinginsight into the participant experience(ex. standard operating procedures for biological specimen collection, debriefing scripts if you are using deception, letters of permission or approval from a hosting institution, etc.)\nYou should upload documents to the relevant sections on your protocol in RASS-IRB, and only need to add documents that are relevant to your research. (For instance, if your project only involves a survey, you would not need to provide a standard operating procedure for the collection of specimens.)\nIf you are a student, you should also ensure that you have a faculty member ready to serve as your advisor for this project. The duties of the faculty advisor are to provide a student PI with guidance on human participant research topics and take responsibility for overseeing the compliance with IRB policies and procedures. The faculty advisor does not need to be involved in the actual conduct of the research; however, they should offer some oversight or guidance. You should discuss this project with any potential faculty advisors to make sure they are willing to take on these responsibilities.\nStep 3: Submit a protocol through RASS-IRB.\nThe Cornell IRB only accepts new protocol applications through theRASS-IRB portal. We have aRASS Guides websitecontaining a multitude of detailed walk-throughs for any number of processes, includingthis guidance documentexplaining how to submit a new application. (https://rass.cornell.edu/irb, https://guide.rass.cornell.edu/, https://guide.rass.cornell.edu/institutional-review-board-for-human-participant-research/create-an-irb-protocol/)\nWhile you are entering information about your protocol into the system, it will automatically assign your protocol a review level based off of regulatory definitions. These levels are: Exempt (subject to administrative review), Expedited (reviewed by a single designated committee member rather than the entire committee) and Full Board (also called \u201cConvened Committee,\u201d reviewed by the entire IRB Committee).\nAs part of this process, all members of your research team (except for students) will be required to complete aConflict of Interest Project-Specific Disclosure. Additionally, the PI \u2013 and the Faculty Advisor, if there is one \u2013 are required to attest that they are willing to take on the responsibilities associated with those roles. These are considered \u2018pre-approval requirements\u2019 and you can check on their status in the Requirements table at the bottom of your protocol. If you are required to provide an attestation, you will receive an email notification, as well as a task on your\"My Tasks\" listin RASS. (/news/conflict-interest-system-launch-plan, https://rass.cornell.edu/mytasks)\nIf you have any questions that have not been addressed by the RASS Guides site, our team is available to provide assistance. For questions related to technical workings of the RASS site (i.e. login troubles, documents not uploading) you can contact our System Administrator colleagues atrass@research.cornell.edu, or make an appointment for support. For questions related to the content of the protocol (i.e. training documentation, requirements for certain application sections) please reach out to IRB Staff viairbhp@cornell.edu, or make an appointment with an IRB Administrator. (mailto:rass@research.cornell.edu, mailto:irbhp@cornell.edu)\nThe earlier you submit your protocol, the better. If you are under a tight timeline, please let the IRB staff know as soon as possible. Please be aware, though, that the IRB office is small and very busy. Each Administrator manages the review of 30-40 protocol submissions each month, on average. Protocols are usually reviewed first come, first served, so prioritizing your protocol over someone else\u2019s will be done at the discretion of the staff.\nStep 4: IRB Administrators/Members will review, make comments, ask questions.\nDuring this step, the IRB Administrators will be reviewing your protocol to ensure that the research you are conducting is compliant with human participant research regulations and protections. An IRB Member may also review your protocol at this point, depending on the review level.\nThe timeline by which you should expect comments to be returned varies based on the review level, the completeness of your initial application, the complexity of the research, and the workload of the IRB Administrator assigned to review your protocol. Our goal is to complete initial review and return a protocol with feedbackwithin two to three weeks of attestation. If it has been longer than this time period for your protocol and you have not heard from an IRB Administrator or received the protocol back, please feel free to reach out toirbhp@cornell.edufor any updates. (mailto:irbhp@cornell.edu)\nPlease note that Administrators cannot begin reviewing protocols while there is an attestation pending from the PI or Faculty Advisor.\nWhile your protocol is under review, you cannot edit it. If during this period you need to make a change to the protocol, please write in toirbhp@cornell.edu, and we can return the protocol to you for you to make changes and re-submit. (mailto:irbhp@cornell.edu)\nStep 5: You take feedback into account, reviewing and responding to comments.\nWhen the initial review is complete, the IRB Administrator will return the protocol with any feedback. You will receive an e-mail when this occurs, and will be able to access and edit the protocol again. We have aRASS Guides documentthat explains how to view and address any questions or requests for changes. If you need clarification about any of these comments, you can write in toirbhp@cornell.eduor make an appointment to meet with the IRB Administrator to discuss. (https://guide.rass.cornell.edu/institutional-review-board-for-human-participant-research/address-feedback-from-irb-review/, mailto:irbhp@cornell.edu)\nOnce you have made the requested edits, you re-submit the protocol so that the Administrator can re-review. Typically, this re-review process is shorter than the initial review, and our Administrators and reviewers try to get additional feedback or a decision regarding approval back within one to two weeks of this re-submission.\nIf your protocol is receiving Expedited or Full Board review, once the IRB Administrator conducting the initial review is satisfied, they will send it to IRB Committee members, who will also provide feedback and may request additional changes to the protocol. If your protocol is receiving Full Board review, it will be discussed atone of the monthly committee meetings. (/resources/about-irb-committee)\nStep 6: Approval\nExpect Exemption determinations to take 3-4 weeks from start to finish, Expedited approvals 4-6 weeks, and Full Board approvals 4-8 weeks. The more complete your application is from the start, and the quicker you respond to review comments, the faster you will receive your approval.\nWhen the reviewers (the IRB Administrator, the IRB Committee members, or the entire IRB Committee) are satisfied with the protocol, the PI and anyone else with editing permissions on the protocol will be sent a notice that the protocol was approved, or was determined to be exempt (the equivalent of approval for Exempt review).You cannot conduct any human participant research, including recruitment, as part of this project before you have received IRB approval.\nStep 7: Amendments, unanticipated problems, and continuing reviews.\nIf you are changing any of the information that you have told the IRB in your initial protocol \u2013 surveys, procedures, research team personnel, informed consent documents, recruitment, etc. \u2013 you should submit an amendment for the protocol. We have aRASS Guides documentdetailing the steps in RASS to submit an amendment. (https://guide.rass.cornell.edu/institutional-review-board-for-human-participant-research/amend-an-irb-protocol/)\nFor Exempt protocols, you do not need to amend the protocol for changes to the research team, excluding the roles of PI or Faculty advisor. This is the only change to a protocol that does not require an amendment. If you are unsure if your change requires an amendment, you can reach out toirbhp@cornell.edu. (mailto:irbhp@cornell.edu)\nResearchers are required to submit a report if there is an unanticipated/adverse event or a protocol deviation. We have more information regarding IRB policies aroundunanticipated/adverse eventsandinstances of noncompliance(including protocol deviations) in Policies 4 and 5 respectively. You should submit these reports via RASS-IRB, and can utilize these RASS Guides for submittingprotocol deviationandunexpected eventreports. (/policies/irb-policy-4-reporting-unanticipatedadverse-events, /policies/irb-policy-5-managing-noncompliance, https://guide.rass.cornell.edu/institutional-review-board-for-human-participant-research/submit-a-protocol-deviation/, https://guide.rass.cornell.edu/institutional-review-board-for-human-participant-research/submit-an-adverse-event/)\nAdditionally, the IRB is required to review every Full Board protocol annually via the continuing review process. You will receive an e-mail notification about 60 days before your protocol\u2019s expiration date. If you are still enrolling participants, interacting with participants, and/or obtaining and analyzing personally identifiable information, you must submit a continuing review request. Our RASS Guides website contains a\u00a0walk-through forsubmitting a continuing review request. (https://guide.rass.cornell.edu/institutional-review-board-for-human-participant-research/submit-continuing-review/)\nStep 8: Closing the protocol.\nWhen your protocol is complete \u2013 if the study is permanently closed to enrollment, all participants have completed all study-related interventions, the collection and analysis of private identifiable information is complete, and any remaining study activities are limited to analysis of de-identified data only\u2013 you shouldsubmit a closure request for your protocol. You can also close the protocol if you do not plan to complete the study, or if the protocol is continuing under the purview of a different IRB. (https://blogs.cornell.edu/rass/institutional-review-board-for-human-participant-research/submit-a-request-to-close-a-protocol/)\nIf you do not have access to a protocol but need to close it, you can reach out toirbhp@cornell.edufor assistance.

Below are the archives of the RCR symposium summaries to report to the NIH. (/resources/responsible-conduct-research-rcr-symposium-and-workshop)\nRCR Symposium Summary\nArchive: RCR Symposium Summaries for the NIH Training Grant\nRCR Symposium 2022: Plagiarism\nThe 2022 RCR (Responsible Conduct of Research) Symposium, hosted by Cornell\u2019s Office of Research Integrity and Assurance (ORIA) was held virtually from April 14th to May 12th, 2022, via Canvas and Zoom. The Symposium analyzed the ethical issues related to this year\u2019s topic: Plagiarism. Approximately 150 students, faculty, and staff participated in the event.\nThe format of this year\u2019s Symposium was as follows: attendees watched pre-recorded lectures about RCR in general and plagiarism in particular. Subsequently, participants attended small break-out discussion sessions led by faculty members and ORIA staff. Each discussion group consisted of 6-12 students and took place from April 14th to May 11th. There were 20 discussion groups in total. The Symposium closed with a panel discussion led by individuals with expertise in the field of plagiarism.\nEach discussion group examined three case studies related to topics such as plagiarism of ideas, the ethics of receiving assistance, and self-plagiarism. These scenarios involve hypothetical researchers and situations which were designed to highlight different considerations and realistic issues related to plagiarism. By using case studies to showcase plagiarism in various research contexts, the attendees were exposed to situations in which plagiarism, or the determination of whether a situation constituted plagiarism, was complicated and conflict-inducing. Attendees also engaged in discussions about how plagiarism or the appearance of plagiarism could cause significant reputational damage.\nSmall discussion groups analyzed the case studies and considered a battery of questions in the context of each of the cases. These questions were shared with the panelists prior to the panel discussion and were discussed during the panel discussion.\nThe panel discussion was live and was held on May 12th via Zoom from 1-2 PM EST. During the panel discussion, attendees had an opportunity to engage with the panelists by asking questions and clarifying comments. The panel discussion was recorded by ORIA and moderated by Mark Hurwitz (Chief Research Compliance Officer). The panelists were Tracy Stokol (Professor in the Department of Population Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine), Conrad Wolan (Senior Associate General Counsel), Volker Vogt (Professor in the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences), and Jim Entwood (arXiv.org Operations Manager, Cornell University).\nRCR Symposium 2021: Conflict of Interest\n[To be Added]\nRCR Symposium 2020:\u00a0Ethical Considerations about Genome Editing\n[To be Added]\nRCR Symposium 2019: Data Acquisition and Management\nThe 2019 Winter Symposium on Responsible Conduct of Research was held on January 17, 2019, in Warren Hall. The symposium focused on ethical issues involved in the management, acquisition, and sharing of research data, and promoted discussion of the topic using case studies discussed in small break-out groups. Just under 200 students, faculty and staff participated in the event; Daniel Barbash, Professor of Molecular Biology and Genetics, was the academic lead.\nTo begin, Professor Barbash spoke about key concepts in data management, what can go wrong, some examples from the literature, relevant funding agency/journal guidelines and requirements, and available resources at Cornell. Professor Barbash then laid the groundwork for the case studies to be discussed, and the participants broke into small groups for discussion. The groups were led by faculty members and graduate students from various disciplines across campus.\nFollowing the small group discussions, the symposium attendees reconvened in the Warren Hall auditorium to reflect on the questions and issues that arose during the break-out sessions. The graduate student discussion group leaders shared key takeaways that were brought up in their groups, and the audience chimed in with other questions and comments.\nRCR Symposium 2018:\u00a0Maintaining Public Trust in Industry-Funded Research\nThe Winter 2018 Symposium on Responsible Conduct of Research was held on January 22, 2018, in Warren Hall. The symposium focused on ethical issues regarding public trust in industry-funded research and promoted discussion of the topic using case studies discussed in small break-out groups. The topic of public trust in industry-funded research was particularly timely and critical, as the university and researchers have become more and more interested in pursuing industry funding in recent years, and such research is becoming more popular.\nAbout 200 students, faculty, and staff participated in the symposium. Patrick Stover, Professor, and Director of the Division of Nutritional Sciences was the academic lead for the event.\nThe case studies discussed at the symposium contained two different scenarios involving hypothetical researchers, and highlighted considerations and dilemmas that researchers might face in the course of their careers. One case study addressed the ethical considerations present when a Ph.D. student working in a lab heavily funded by industry is interested in pursuing research that could yield results that may be detrimental to that industry funder. The second case described a scenario in which a faculty member was offered a large grant with valuable data from a company, but the terms of the grant\u2014included allowing the company to provide only select data, and restricting payment unless the research results are satisfactory to the company\u2014were not acceptable to the university.\nTo begin the event, Professor Patrick Stover spoke about the challenges, benefits, and considerations involved when researchers pursue funding from the industry. Professor Stover also addressed the issue of maintaining the public\u2019s trust when researchers are funded by industry and provided examples of how this issue is addressed in the Nutrition field. Professor Stover laid the groundwork for the case studies to be discussed, and the participants broke into smaller groups for discussion. The discussion groups were led by faculty members and graduate students from across a multitude of graduate fields.\nThe small discussion groups considered many issues arising from each of the cases and provided their own questions to the entire audience, which were addressed at a panel discussion held at the end of the symposium. In the panel segment of the event, Professors Stover, Marie Caudill, David Erickson, Frank Schroeder, and Bettina Wagner, and the Director of the Office of Sponsored Programs, Mary-Margaret Klempa, led a discussion with faculty and students about their personal experiences regarding the maintenance of public trust when researchers are funded by industry and addressed questions which arose during the small group discussions.\nRCR Symposium 2017:\u00a0Rigor and Reproducibility\nThe Winter 2017 Symposium on Responsible Conduct of Research was held on January 23, 2017, in Warren Hall. The symposium focused on ethical issues regarding rigor and reproducibility in research and promoted discussion of the topic using the case study method. The topic of rigor and reproducibility in research was particularly timely and critical, as we have seen an increased focus by sponsors, journals, and the public on ensuring that researchers follow and document how their scientific design, methods, and reporting meet the highest standards of integrity and rigor.\nAbout 200 students, faculty, and staff participated in the symposium. Dr. Nozomi Nishimura, Assistant Professor in Biomedical Engineering, was the academic lead for this symposium, which also featured a keynote address by Dr. Michael G. Kaplitt, Professor and Vice Chair of Research in Neurological Surgery, and Director of Movement Disorders and Pain at Weill Cornell Medicine.\nThe case studies contained two different scenarios involving a hypothetical researcher, and highlighted considerations and dilemmas that researchers might face in the course of doing their research. One case study dealt with the tricky issue of \u201cP-hacking\u201d which occurs when researchers collect data or conduct statistical analyses to yield a target result, and for non-significant results to become significant. The second case described a scenario in which a student designed a study with live animals and got encouraging results, but it became apparent that in the design and conduct of his experiments he had ignored several important variables that may have had an effect on the outcome.\nAfter a brief welcome from Andrew Bass (Professor, Neurobiology, and Behavior; Senior Associate Vice Provost for Research), Dr. Mike Kaplitt spoke about the challenges in translational research and brought attention to how a lack of rigor in pre-clinical studies can have real, substantial, and negative implications for clinical studies directly affecting human health. Dr. Nishimura then set up the groundwork for the case studies that were to be discussed. After a short break, participants broke into smaller groups for discussion. The discussion groups were led by a faculty member and a graduate student from across graduate fields in the life sciences.\nThe individual groups considered many questions in the context of each of the cases and sent in responses to two questions from the case studies, which were displayed at the final wrap-up discussion session. In this wrap-up session, Dr. Nishimura led a discussion with faculty and students about the principles and practical considerations to ensure rigor and reproducibility in life sciences research.\nRCR Symposium 2016: Plagiarism\nThe Winter 2016 RCR Symposium was held on January 25, 2016, in Uris Hall Auditorium on the Cornell University campus in Ithaca New York. The symposium focused on the ethical issues related to plagiarism. About 170 students, faculty, and staff participated in the symposium. As in prior symposia (2012, 2014, 2015), we used the case study method to engage participants in the discussion. The format of this year's symposium was as follows: an introduction to all participants by the faculty member who serves as the academic lead, followed by small break-out discussion sessions, and then a final panel discussion for all participants.\nThe case study for discussion contained two different scenarios involving hypothetical researchers to highlight different considerations and realistic issues related to the challenges in defining plagiarism in the various research contexts - grant proposals, reviews of manuscripts, type of information being considered, expectations of collaborators - that make these determinations tricky, can potentially induce conflict and could result in significant reputational harm to researchers. After a brief welcome from Professor Andrew Bass (Neurobiology and Behavior; Senior Associate Vice Provost for Research), Professor Maurine Linder (Chair, Molecular Medicine) gave an introduction to the basic principles of plagiarism and the case scenarios to be discussed. After a short break, participants broke into smaller groups for discussion. Each discussion group of 6-12 students was led by a faculty member and a graduate student from across many different graduate fields in the life sciences.\nThe individual groups considered many questions in the context of each of the cases, including: What are the ethical considerations that underlie plagiarism decisions? What are the criteria typically used in determining whether plagiarism has occurred? What are the obligations of reviewers when they are reviewing manuscripts for publication? Is self-plagiarism a thing and if so, when? If conflicts about plagiarism do arise, what are the available paths to resolve those conflicts? At the conclusion of the discussion, each group wrote one or two questions that they felt should be taken up in the panel discussion.\nThe panel discussion was moderated by Richard Cerione (Goldwin Smith Professor of Pharmacology and Chemical Biology, Departments of Molecular Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine and Chemistry and Chemical Biology, College of Arts and Sciences). Other panelists were Professor Barbara Baird (Horace White Professor of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, College of Arts and Sciences). Robert Oswald (Professor, Department of Molecular Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine), Maureen Hanson (Liberty Hyde Bailey Professor, Department of Molecular Biology & Genetics, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences), and Maurine Linder (Professor and Chair, Department of Molecular Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine). Professor Jeffrey Benovic (Professor and Chair of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Thomas Jefferson University Medical School, Associate Editor of the ACS Journal Biochemistry) was also invited to participate in the panel but was unable to join panel due to inclement weather. The panelists considered many of the questions posed by the attendees. Faculty and Students in the audience participated in the discussion as well.\nThe symposium closed with a note of thanks from the organizers and a request by Professor Linder for students to take the discussions back to their research groups and engage in more in-depth discussions of policy and practice with their research groups and their faculty mentors.\nRCR Symposium 2015:\u00a0Ethical Issues in Ethnographic Research\nThe Spring 2015 Symposium on Responsible Conduct of Research was held on April 10th, 2015 in Clark Hall\u2019s Auditorium and Bethe Lecture Room. Faculty members Adam Smith (Professor and Chair of Anthropology), Paul Nadasdy (Associate Professor of Anthropology and American Indian Studies), and Erick White (Visiting Professor of South and Southeast Asian Religions) helped develop the format and select topics of discussion for the event.\nThe symposium, which was focused on ethical questions around maintaining the confidentiality of research participants in ethnographic research, used two case studies that highlighted very different considerations for researchers. Case 1: \"Legal Requests for Confidential Data from Research Field Notes\" presented the quandary of a researcher who promises confidentiality to her teenage research participants but is asked by police to turn over field notes as part of a criminal investigation. Case 2: \"Anonymity Declined\" describes a situation where a researcher anonymized the identities of research subjects in her ethnography, but discovers afterward that the majority of them were not happy with remaining anonymous.\nFollowing a short welcome presentation by Adam Smith, the participants broke into two small groups to discuss the case studies. Small group discussions were led by Marina Welker (Associate Professor of Anthropology and Asian Studies) and Paul Nadasdy. Discussions touched upon many aspects of each case. Participants and discussion leaders brought up possible consequences to both researchers and participants; the ethical obligations of the protagonists in each case; upon what professional norms and values ethical obligations were based; and who stakeholders were in each situation. Numerous questions arose during the discussion. As a default strategy to protect participants, is providing anonymity always the best idea in every case? Are there other ways ethnographic researchers can reasonably protect the rights of their research participants? Is it possible to truly guarantee confidentiality to participants?\nAfter small group discussions, the participants reconvened for a panel discussion with faculty who had expertise in this area of research. Adam Smith moderated the discussion and posed issues raised in the discussion groups to panelists Erick White, Elaine Wethington (Professor of Human Development and Co-Director of the Cornell Institute for Translational Research on Aging), Shannon Gleeson (Associate Professor of Labor Relations, Law and History) and Steven Jackson (Associate Professor of Information Science and Director of Graduate Studies for Information Science). The panelists brought unique perspectives to the discussion as well as varying experiences with ethnographic research and added illustrative examples drawn from their experiences in the field. The closing discussions left participants with a greater appreciation both for the complexity of the ethical issues raised and the importance of carefully considering the ethics of anonymity during research design.\nRCR Symposium 2015:\u00a0Authorship\nThe Winter 2015 Symposium on Responsible Conduct of Research was held on January 16, 2015, in Uris Hall Auditorium. The symposium focused on ethical issues around authorship and promoted discussion of authorship using the case study method. About 200 students, faculty, and staff participated in the symposium. The format of this year's symposium was similar to the one from last year: an introduction by the faculty member who serves as the Academic Lead, small break-out discussion sessions, followed by a panel discussion.\nThe case study for discussion contained three different scenarios involving a hypothetical researcher to highlight different considerations regarding authorship decisions and realistic issues related to the power inequity between advisors and students and between collaborators that make these decisions tricky and can potentially induce conflict. After a brief welcome from Andrew Bass (Professor, Neurobiology, and Behavior; Senior Associate Vice Provost for Research), Professor Volker Vogt (Molecular Biology and Genetics) gave an introduction to the basic principles of authorship and the case scenarios to be discussed. After a short break, participants broke into smaller groups for discussion. Each discussion group was led by a faculty member and a graduate student from across many different graduate fields in the life sciences.\nThe individual groups considered many questions in the context of each of the cases, including: What are the ethical considerations that underlie authorship decisions? What are the criteria typically used in making authorship decisions? In a list of authors, what is the significance of the order of names in the list? How can conflicts regarding authorship be avoided? If conflicts about authorship do arise, what are the available paths to resolve those conflicts?\nIn focusing on why an action in each scenario might be considered acceptable or unacceptable, discussion group members considered the following factors: Who has a stake in the action? What might be the consequences of the action? What might be the obligations of the protagonist? What professional norms and values might give rise to those obligations?\nAt the conclusion of the discussion, each group wrote some questions that they felt should be taken up at the panel discussion. The panel discussion was moderated by Professor Tony Bretscher,(Professor, Molecular Biology and Genetics, Weill Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology). Other panelists were Jan Allen (Associate Dean, Academic, and Student Affairs, Graduate School), Yimon Aye (Assistant Professor, Chemistry & Chemical Biology), Maggie Gustafson (Graduate Student, Field of Biochemistry, Molecular and Cell Biology, Weill Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology), Mark Roberson (Professor and Chair, Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine) and Charles Walcott (Professor Emeritus, Neurobiology, and Behavior; University Ombudsman) The panelists considered many of the questions posed by the attendees. Faculty and Students in the audience participated in the discussion as well.\nThe symposium closed with a note of thanks from the organizers and a request by Professor Volker Vogt for students to take the discussions back to their research groups and engage in more in-depth discussions of policy and practice with their research groups and their faculty mentors.\nRCR Symposium 2014: Human Subjects Research\nThe second Symposium on Responsible Conduct in Research for students in the Life Sciences and Engineering was held on January 17, 2014, under the academic leadership of Professor Kathleen Rasmussen, Professor of Nutrition in the Division of Nutritional Sciences and International Professor of Nutritional Science at Cornell. Professor Rasmussen and the Cornell Faculty Steering Committee for RCR jointly developed the topic and format of the symposium. The symposium focused on the issues related to conducting research with human subjects including research with biomaterials obtained from human subjects, using the case study \"Use of genetic materials in the case of Havasupai Tribe.\"\nOver one hundred and twenty graduate students and over 15 faculty members participated in the symposium. Professor Rasmussen started the symposium by providing an overview of the information about the case, including the timeline, the individuals involved, the debate, the legal and ethical issues raised, and the final outcome of the controversy. After this presentation, the students and faculty broke into small groups of 10-12, with a faculty member and a graduate student as discussion leaders. Each group discussed two out of the 10 questions posed about various ethical questions related to the case, and the issues it raised for their own work at Cornell. After the small group discussions, the entire group reconvened for a panel discussion with individuals who had expertise in the various aspects of the case and moderated by Professor Rasmussen. The panelists were Dr. Angela Gonzalez (Associate Professor, Development Sociology), whose research interests include research with Native American communities; Dr. Carol Devine (Professor, Division of Nutritional Sciences; Chair, Institutional Review Board); Ms. Nora Salvatore (Assistant University Counsel); and Dr. Andrew Clark (Professor, Molecular Biology and Genetics). Each group presented their responses to the questions that were posed to their group, and the panelists provided additional perspectives and clarifications on the topic.\nThe symposium ended with closing comments from Amita Verma, the Director of the Office of Research Integrity and Assurance. Following the symposium, a reception was held for the attending students and faculty.\nRCR Symposium 2012: Research Misconduct\nOn January 10, 2012, the first Cornell Responsible Conduct in Research symposium for students in the Life Sciences and Engineering was held. The symposium was developed and planned in the fall of 2011 by Professor Andy Bass (Senior Associate Vice Provost for Research), Tilman Baumstark (Assistant Dean for Professional Development in the Graduate School), Professor Mark Robertson (Chair, Department of Biomedical Sciences), Professor Robert Oswald (Pharmacology), and Park Doing (Lecturer, Bovay Program in Engineering Ethics). One hundred and thirty graduate students and several faculty members participated in the symposium. At the start of the symposium, Park Doing presented the case of the Harvard researcher Marc Hauser, who resigned from Harvard after questions were raised about his practices by students in his own research group and an investigation was conducted by Harvard that found him \"solely responsible\" for eight instances of misconduct in both published and unpublished research. After this presentation, the students and faculty broke into small groups of 8-9 and discussed both the case and the issues it raised for their own work at Cornell. After the small group discussions, the entire group reconvened and discussed the conclusions of each group in a session moderated by Park Doing and Mark Robertson. At the end of the symposium, Assistant Dean Baumstark outlined for the students the channels available to them at Cornell in order to report research misconduct. After the symposium, a reception was held where students and faculty could talk and interact informally.\nOffice of Sponsored Programs (OSP) & Research Development (/offices/osp)\nResponsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Office (/offices/rcr)\nResearch Integrity (/resources/research-integrity)\nThe Research Integrity Council (/resources/research-integrity-council)\nResponsible Conduct of Research Committee (RCRC) (/resources/responsible-conduct-research-committee-rcrc)\nResearch Data Retention (/resources/research-data-retention)\nResponsible Conduct of Research (RCR) (/compliance/rcr)\nResponsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Topics and Case Studies (/resources/responsible-conduct-research-rcr-topics-and-case-studies)\nRCR Requirements for Research Awards (/resources/rcr-requirements-research-awards)\nResponsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Symposium and Workshop (/resources/responsible-conduct-research-rcr-symposium-and-workshop)\nQuick Reference\nRates (/rates)\nForms (/forms)\nPolicies (/policies)\nContacts (/contacts)\nTraining (/training)\nEvents (/events)\nNews & Announcements (/news)\n\u00a9 2019 Cornell University\nWeb Accessibility Help (mailto:rais-help@cornell.edu?subject=researchservices.cornell.edu%20site)"

Include link to RFA and deadline dates.\nBudget Restrictions:With our limited budget, our aim is to fund as many exciting proposals as possible, so please be reasonable with your budget request. We expect most proposals to be in the range of $10,000 - $30,000 (including both Phase I and Phase II budgets). In Phase I, applicants can apply for up to $10,000, with the remaining amount to be requested in the Phase II application. These resources are intended to support experiments that provide preliminary data for extramural applications, however limited salary support for staff can be provided, up to 50% of the full (Phase I and II combined). Faculty salary, stipends and travel are not eligible expenses, and no indirect costs can be recovered. Please note that Phase II funds will not be released to the applicant until a successful Phase II application has been awarded.\nReview Process for Phase I:Applications will be reviewed by a multi-disciplinary committee that has been specially convened for this purpose. We aim to review the applications within one week. Due to the volume of applications anticipated, we will not be able to provide review summaries to applicants. We hope to provide applicants ayesornoresponse and an approved budget allocation within one week of applying. No revised applications will be accepted for review.\nNote: Phase I applications will be reviewed every 2 weeks. While we are eager to fund excellent projects in a timely fashion, we anticipate that we will have funds to support proposals over the next few months.\u00a0 Hence, we urge applicants to take the time necessary to hone their proposals before submitting.\nCompliance Requirements:All SARS-CoV-2 research requires approval from the SARS-CoV-2 Essential Research Approval Committee (SERAC) and from your College-specific approval committee. SERAC review, if not already obtained, can be requested concurrent with submission of your proposal but must be submitted through theSERAC rapid research approval process. Additionally, you are required to fulfill any compliance obligations such as approval for your research activities through IACUC, IBC, IRB, etc., prior to allocation of funds. All research performed under this seed proposal mechanism is subject to all university policies pertaining to COVID-19. (/resources/serac-now-closed)\nPhase II Process:In order to be considered for Phase II funding, Phase I awardees will be required to submit a Progress Report and Phase II application within 6 weeks from the commencement of the research. This time frame can be negotiated through direct communication with the Review Committee Chair, especially if the proposed activities are expected to require more time to achieve initial goals, or if time is needed to obtain the necessary approvals. If a Phase II application is approved, remaining funds approved in the Phase I application will be dispersed. If rejected, the committed funds will go back into the pool. Phase II applications will consist of a single document, instructions for which will be issued later. All funds must be used within 6 months of the initial award, with extramural grant applications submitted within one year.\nFor questions and comments, please emailCarmel LeeorPaula Cohen.

Principal Investigators (PI) are primarily responsible, with assistance from department research administrators (DRA), for ensuring that sponsored funds are spent in accordance with regulations, policies, and award terms.\nWhere a project subcontracts (also known as subawards) work and funding to a subrecipient (also known as subawardee), the PI may be the only one aware of the subrecipient\u2019s technical progress and whether a particular payment should be made.\nThe PI, therefore, should authorize payment and be given the opportunity to raise any concerns prior to payment.\nUnder normal situations payments must be made within 30 days.\nDelays required to resolve invoice concerns should be fully documented in the payment eDoc.\nFinal Invoice or Invoice from Elevated Risk Subrecipient\nThe Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP) and Sponsored Financial Services (SFS) determine if asubaward or subrecipient is assessed as posing \u201celevated\u201d riskand notify the department research administrator\u00a0and PI of the risk determination and all actions required to manage this risk. (/resources/subawards-risk-assessment)\nNote:\u00a0A designation of \u201celevated risk\u201d is assigned following a review of subcontractor documentation related to financial status and financial management controls. A subcontractor will be deemed \u201celevated risk\u201d if it is determined that they lack essential controls and thus pose an increased risk for non-compliance with technical or administrative requirements of the award. The designation is provided to allow the PI, the department research administrator, OSP and SFS to use additional caution in monitoring and during the review of invoices to ensure that procedures and subcontract terms are followed.\nThe department research administrator receives the subaward invoices. The department research administrator and PI have responsibilities. Seedefinitions in the Roles and Responsibilities page. (/resources/subawards-roles-and-responsibilities)\nThe department research administrator\u00a0provides the PI (or formal technical designee*) a copy of the invoice, any supporting documentation, and review instructions.\nThe PI (or designee) must review**and approve or disapprove the payment, by signing the invoice, e-mail notification, or other written means.\nThe department research administrator must obtain and this documentation attach\u00a0it to the Disbursement Voucher (DV) eDoc when processed.\nAll Other Invoices (Not Final or Elevated Risk)\nThe department research administrator provides the PI (or formal technical designee*) a copy of the invoice, any supporting documentation, and review instructions.\nThe PI (or designee) must review the payment and notify the unit administrator withinthree business daysif there is any reason that the payment\u00a0should not\u00a0be made.\nIf no response is received by the department research administrator\u00a0within three business days it is presumed that PI has no concerns with the payment. The DV eDoc note field or invoice must include the notation \u201cPI notified, no issues communicated\u201d\u00a0or have attached any PI response.\n*The PI may designate an individual on their project team to provide the technical review and approval. A designee must have sufficient responsibility within the project (for example, research associate, lab manager), technical understanding, and knowledge of subrecipient requirements and performance. Department research administrators are normally not technically qualified to assume this responsibility. Delegation must be documented in writing, noted in the Account Expense Guideline Text in Kuali Financial System (with the authorization attached to the ACCT document), and with a copy retained by the department research administrator.\n**The purpose of PI review is to ensure that the subrecipient\u2019s technical progress is aligned with the amount of the specific and cumulative invoice.\u00a0 When approving the invoice the PI should be comfortable that:\nPerformance on the subaward as of the invoice date is satisfactory. If not, the PI should discuss this with the subrecipient.\nThe proportion of the overall subrecipient invoice is commensurate with the progress to date, or that the PI understands and agrees with a significant deviation. (For example,\u00a0it is reasonable if 10% of the subaward has been billed, and the work is 10% complete or if front-loaded costs such as equipment result in a 25% expended / 10% completed ratio. However, a project 10% complete and 50% billed may be cause for concern).\nAll required technical progress reports or deliverables have been received and reviewed.\nNote: the PI should contact OSP if a sufficient lack of progress or deliverables could negatively impact the project, or if there are other significant\u00a0 irregularities with the invoice.\nSample Invoices\n\nThe subrecipient shall submit invoices for payment as outlined in the terms and conditions of their subaward.\nAll subrecipientsshall certify on each invoice the costs are the actual costs as recorded in the subrecipient's records and as expended, or in accordance with a fixed price subaward, for the actual work performed per the agreement.\nFederally funded awardsshall have a certification equivalent to that required under\u00a02 CFR 200.415:\n[By signing this report, I certify to the best of my knowledge and belief that the report is true, complete, and accurate, and the expenditures, disbursements and cash receipts are for the purposes and objectives set forth in the terms and conditions of the Federal award. I am aware that any false, fictitious, or fraudulent information, or the omission of any material fact, may subject me to criminal, civil or administrative penalties for fraud, false statements, false claims or otherwise.

Such approval asserts that the PI has performed their required review.\nIn order to be eligible for reimbursement, invoices shall be for allowable, approved costs incurred in accordance with the terms of the agreement and shall indicate expenses for reimbursement by budget category, identifying the total project costs, the reimbursable costs and the subrecipient\u2019s cost share pursuant to the submitted budget.\nAn authorized representative of the subrecipient shall certify on each invoice that the costs, including those requested for reimbursement and those shown as the subrecipient cost share, are the actual costs as recorded in subrecipient\u2019s records and as expended for the work actually performed in accordance with the terms of the subaward.\nProposing a Subaward (/resources/proposing-subaward)\nSubawards: Roles and Responsibilities (/resources/subawards-roles-and-responsibilities)\nIssuing the Subaward Agreement (/resources/issuing-subaward-agreement)\n\nAmendment to Subaward Agreements (/resources/amendment-subaward-agreements)\nSubaward Closeout (/resources/subaward-closeout)\nSubawards: Risk Assessment (/resources/subawards-risk-assessment)\nSubrecipient Monitoring: Financial and Technical (/resources/subrecipient-monitoring-financial-and-technical)\nFederal Demonstration Partnership (FDP) Expanded Clearinghouse Program (/resources/federal-demonstration-partnership-fdp-expanded-clearinghouse-program)\nSubcontractor Commitment Form (/forms/subcontractor-commitment-form)\nCollaborating with Weill Cornell Medicine (/process/collaborating-weill-cornell-medicine)\nQuick Reference\nRates (/rates)\nForms (/forms)\nPolicies (/policies)\nContacts (/contacts)\nTraining (/training)\nEvents (/events)\nNews & Announcements (/news)\n\u00a9 2019 Cornell University\nWeb Accessibility Help (mailto:rais-help@cornell.edu?subject=researchservices.cornell.edu%20site)"

The role of the IRB is to ensure the protection of human participants in a research study. Any institution that receives federal funding to conduct research with human participants is required to establish an IRB and to review and approve studies prior to collection of research data. The Cornell IRB operates under a Federalwide Assurance (FWA 0000 4513) through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, seecharge. (/sites/default/files/2019-05/IRB-Charge-2014_0.pdf)\nHow do I know if I am conducting research with human participants?\nAlthough the question may seem straightforward, not all interactions with human beings or data collected from humans are considered research under IRB rules. If your project is not considered research, you do not need to submit an application to the IRB office. If your project is considered research under IRB rules, you must submit an application to the IRB office and receive approval before research can begin.\nResearch under IRB regulations (as specified under the \u2018Common Rule\u2019 issued by the Office of Human Research Protections, U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services) and Cornell policy is defined as a systematic investigation, including research development, testing and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge.\nA human participant is defined as a living (not deceased) individual about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research obtains (1) data through intervention or interaction with the individual, or obtains (2) identifiable private information about that individual.\nGeneralizable knowledge refers to information that expands the knowledge base of a scientific discipline or other scholarly field of study and can be expressed in theories, principles, or statements of relationships that can be generally applied to our experiences. Activities designed to contribute to generalizable knowledge are those designed to draw general conclusions, inform policy, or generalize findings beyond a single individual or an internal program. The information is collected to share with others in a discipline and is created to make a broad statement (conclusion) about a group of people, procedures, programs, etc.\nAn intervention can include physical procedures by which data are gathered (e.g., venipuncture) and manipulations of the subject or subject's environment for research purposes.\nInteraction includes communication or interpersonal contact between the researcher and subject.\nPrivate information includes information about behavior that occurs in a context in which an individual can reasonably expect that no observation or recording is taking place, and information which has been provided for specific purposes by an individual and which the individual can reasonably expect will not be made public (for example, a medical record). Private information must be individually identifiable (i.e., the identity of a participant is associated with the information or may readily be ascertained by the investigator) in order for obtaining the information to constitute research involving human subjects.\nWhen am I required to submit an IRB application to the IRB office?\nNot all interactions with human beings or data collected from humans are considered research under IRB rules. If your project is not considered research, you do not need to submit an application to the IRB office. If your project is considered research under IRB rules, you must submit an application to the IRB office viaRASS-IRBand receive approval (or an exemption determination) before research can begin. Applications must be submitted to the IRB office for review and approval before data collection begins. This includes proposed research involving existing secondary data and previously collected human fluid and tissue samples. SeePolicy 1. (https://rass.cornell.edu/irb, /policies/irb-policy-1-determining-whether-research-activity-needs-irb-review-and-approval, /sites/default/files/2024-10/IRB_Policy_1_FINAL_01.30.24.pdf)\nI am just doing a simple survey; do I need to submit my proposal to the IRB?\nYes, if the study meets the definition for research with human participants, as explained above. Cornell University's Federalwide Assurance (FWA) with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services states that all research being conducted under the auspices of this institution is subject to review and approval by the IRB. Written approval from the IRB must be in place before any interventions or interactions with human participants (e.g., recruitment) actually begin.\nI am not collecting any identifying information in my human participant research project. Do I need to submit my proposal to the IRB for review?\nYes, if your research project involves active data collection. IRB regulations require that ALL research involving intervention or interaction with human participants, regardless of whether or not identifying information is being collected, must be submitted for review prior to beginning the study. If your research involves the use of existing data collected from human participants (e.g., secondary datasets, existing biological samples), but there are no identifiers linking human participants to the data/samples themselves, then the activity may not require IRB review and may be considered \"not human participant research\". Please see theIRB's Decision Treeor contact the IRB staff for further guidance. (/sites/default/files/2019-05/IRB%20Decision%20Tree.pdf)\nDo research projects conducted by Cornell students need IRB approval?\nYes, studies conducted by Cornell undergraduate and graduate students need IRB approval, if the project fits the definitions of \"research\" and \"human participants\" as described above. If the project is to be used in the classroom setting only to teach research methods (i.e., only only intended to meet a class requirement), the project may not constitute human participant research. However, this means that at no point during or after the conclusion of the course can the results or the data be used for publication, presentation, or other research purposes. Therefore, students should discuss these limitations with their instructor or faculty advisor so that they can determine whether IRB review is necessary.Please note, undergraduate and graduate theses and dissertations are considered research, and will require IRB approval if human participants are involved.\nCan researchers be subjects in their own studies? Does self-experimentation require IRB review?\nYes, researchers can be subjects in their own studies. However, Cornell policy regards this type of research (investigator self-experimentation) as research with human participants, and generally requires the same review and approval as research that recruits other people as subjects.\nThough investigator self-experimentation may not raise the conventional ethical concerns outlined in theBelmont Report, all human research projects should undergo ethical review to assure the safety of people involved and the integrity of the research at the university. While researchers may be aware of the risks of self-experimentation, they may also be more willing to accept risks that are ill-advised. Application for review with the IRB office allows a neutral third party to raise concerns and/or propose measures to promote the welfare of researchers. (http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/)\nWhat is a Program Development application? Can I get IRB approval if I am not ready to recruit participants?\nProgram Development approval is an administrative approval granted by IRB staff so that the Principal Investigator can develop research design methods and materials. This type of approval is often used for the purpose of releasing funds. It is also useful if the actual human interaction portion of the research is expected to occur at a later date, but the researcher needs to provide proof to the sponsor that the project scope and intent has been approved by the local IRB.\nImportant Note:Under this type of administrative approval no human participants may be involved in any activities defined as research until the entire project, including data collection procedures and study instruments, recruitment materials and informed consent documents have been reviewed and approved by the IRB. That is, once the project and study instruments are developed and finalized, please amend your protocol inRASS-IRBto include all relevant study details and study instruments, and the IRB will conduct a complete review and approval. Contact IRB staff with questions regarding whether a Program Development approval can be an option for your research project. (https://rass.cornell.edu/irb)\nWhat does \"exempt\" mean? Does this mean I don't have to submit an application for review?\nStudies that meet the definition of regulated research under the Common Rule may fit within one or more categories of \u201cexempt\u201d research. This doesnotmean that such studies do not need IRB review.In order for a research study to be deemed \"exempt\", investigators will need to submit an application to the IRB office, along with study related materials (e.g., consent forms, surveys, questionnaires, interview scripts/outlines, etc.). Please note that this determination of exemption must be made by IRB staff. SeePolicy #2. (/policies/irb-policy-2-submission-requirements-and-procedures-exemption-irb-review)\nI will be collaborating with another institution. Do I need to submit to Cornell's IRB and the other institution?\nTypically, Cornell researchers must receive Cornell IRB approval to conduct research with human participants, regardless of where the research takes place. When collaborative projects are expected to involve researchers from multiple institutions, contact the IRB office to determine next steps.\u00a0 While, in some cases, each investigator should work with their own institution\u2019s IRB, in other cases it might be desirable (or required by a funder) to arrange an IRB reliance/authorization agreement (IAA) to designate one IRB to review and approve the research as a whole.\nMy research will be done in another country. Do I have to obtain IRB review and approval from Cornell?\nYes, Cornell PIs must receive Cornell IRB approval to conduct research with human participants, regardless of where the research takes place.You should also be aware that your project may need local IRB approval (or the equivalent ethical review), in addition to Cornell's. Please seeSOP #14for more information about requirements for international human participant research. (/policies/irb-policy-14-international-human-research)\nI want to conduct a study that involves the use of deception. Is this allowed? What do I need to consider?\nThe use of deception in research is not prohibited by either the federal regulations or Cornell. However, because at some level the use of deception in research violates the trust that the participant puts in the researcher, this method should be considered carefully. Deliberate deception of participants may occur only in situations where withholding information about the nature of the study is necessary to ensure valid results, and never to get participants to do something that they would not do if the information was fully disclosed to them.\nResearchers should describe for the IRB the method, rationale and the process of informing participants of the purpose of the research as early as is feasible - preferably at the conclusion of an individual's participation through a \"debriefing\" process (but no later than at the conclusion of data collection) to permit participants to withdraw their data, if they choose to do so. Additionally, researchers should provide a justification for the deception techniques and document that there are no equally effective non-deceptive techniques available. Please refer to the American Psychological Association'sEthical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conductfor further guidance. (http://www.apa.org/ethics/code/index.aspx)\nI am planning to do an oral history project; do I need to submit my proposal to the IRB?\nResearch that involves the collection and use of oral histories or life historiesto draw generalizable conclusionsmay meet the federal definition of \"human subjects research\" and require an application to the IRB office. However, not all oral history projects fit this description, and thus would not need IRB review. Please seeGuidance on IRB Review of Projects Collecting Oral (or Life) Histories, Journalism or Case Studiesfor further information. (/sites/default/files/2019-05/Oral_History_IRB_Guidance.pdf)\nI am planning to conduct a pilot study to help refine my data collection procedures and instruments; do I need to submit my proposal to the IRB?\nPilot studies may not meet the regulatory definition of research in need of IRB review. If all of the following statements are true, then no IRB review or approval is needed for your pilot:\n1. The sole intent of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility of a larger study. It is exploratory in nature, helping refine data collection procedures and instruments or preparing a better research design.\n2. There is no intent to publish or disseminate the pilot study outcomes as research data.\n3. The pilot study will be conducted on a small scale (~10 or fewer participants).\nSuch a pilot study would not contribute to generalizable knowledge and therefore isnotconsidered research.\u00a0IRB review is not required.\u00a0Data collection from the pilotcannotbe used as research data.Investigators should still take proper care in protecting human participants (e.g., informed consent process, adequate data security procedures, etc.).\nNote: If your pilot study will involve vulnerable populations or more than minimal risk research procedures, you must consult with theIRB officeprior to data collection. (/offices/IRB)\nI am developing case studies; do I need to submit my proposal to the IRB?\nProjects that use multiple case studies to draw conclusions that are applicable in a generalizable context, or to address a hypothesis, may meet the federal definition of \"human subjects research\" and require review by the IRB office. Other projects involving case studies may not require IRB review. Please seeGuidance on IRB Review of Projects Collecting Oral (or Life) Histories, Journalism or Case Studiesfor further information. (/sites/default/files/2019-05/Oral_History_IRB_Guidance.pdf)\nDoes journalism require IRB review?\nThe reporting of current events, trends, newsworthy issues or stories about people or events generally does not meet the federal definition of \"human subjects research\" and therefore requires no application to the IRB office. However, reporting intended to draw generalizable conclusions may require review by the IRB. Please seeGuidance on IRB Review of Projects Collecting Oral (or Life) Histories, Journalism or Case Studiesfor further information. (/sites/default/files/2019-05/Oral_History_IRB_Guidance.pdf)\nWhen may I begin data collection for my study?\nYou must receive written approval from the IRBbeforebeginning participant recruitment, data collection, or data analysis. A memo will be sent to you via e-mail when your project has IRB approval.\nHow long will it take for me to obtain approval to do my study?\nThat depends on the nature of your study and the characteristics of the people you intend to recruit. Research projects may be eligible for an exemption from IRB committee review, for which you should allow at least 2-3 weeks for administrative review. Research projects that involve only minimal risk to participants but aren't eligible for exemption may be eligible for expedited IRB review, for which you should allow at least 3-4 weeks for review. Projects that involve greater than minimal risk to participants will need to go to the convened full board committee for review, which is scheduled for the first Friday of every month. For applications requiring full board review, you should allow at least 4-6 weeks for review and approval of your study.\nCan the IRB approve a project \"retroactively?\"\nNo. There is no provision in the federal regulations that allow for IRB approval of research that has already been conducted. If data were collected for purposes that the IRB determines to be non-research (e.g., program evaluations for library or educational programs not initially intended to be used for research), IRB approval can be sought for the data analysis going forward.\n\nThe Application Process\nI don't know where to start to write an application. What needs to be included?\nEvery new protocol application must be submitted throughRASS-IRB, which uses a smart form that will lead you through the necessary steps of the application process. You can also learn more about the IRB protocol submission process and what information is needed onour website. Feel free to contact theIRB officefor assistance. (https://rass.cornell.edu/irb, /resources/submit-or-manage-your-irb-protocol, /offices/IRB)\nAre there \"sample\" protocol submissions available for research projects in specific disciplines?\nUnfortunately, not at this time. The IRB staff is available to answer questions about the IRB review process and to assist investigators in the preparation of protocols. On the IRB website there are several IRB policies that can guide the researcher in determining IRB requirements in approving a protocol. The IRB also encourages researchers to consult with colleagues and/or faculty advisors who have done research at Cornell in for advice in preparing research protocols.\nWhat does the IRB look for in an application? Are there standard criteria for evaluation?\nThe IRB evaluates every research protocol according to the ethical principles described in the (Belmont Report). Basically, this means the IRB considers whether the risks and benefits of a study are acceptable and managed appropriately, and whether individuals being asked to participate are adequately informed about the research and its possible risks. (http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/belmont.html)\nConsidered another way, investigators could look at their plans from the point of view of a subject, or an observer concerned about responsible research. Who are the subjects and how are they recruited? Could they be lured or coerced to participate? Is it through an institution that may have responsibilities toward them (e.g., a school or hospital) and should be consulted? Do they understand, in advance, what they are agreeing to participate in and give their consent willingly? What will they actually do, and what is done to them, during the study? Is it possible that the experience might be injurious, painful, uncomfortable, needlessly boring, embarrassing, offensive, or otherwise stressful? Might there be long-term consequences? Could the subject be endangered, compromised or embarrassed if information collected leaked out? There are many possible considerations, but they should not be difficult to understand if one assumes the subject's perspective. The IRB's role is to look at the study from this perspective and to ensure that proper precautions are taken to protect individuals when they agree to participate in research.\n\nThe Consenting Process\nWhat does \"informed consent\" mean? What are its essential components?\nFully informing participants of the risks, benefits, and procedures involved in a study is a standard requirement in research with human participants. Ethically and legally, consent is not considered to be \"informed\" unless the investigator discloses all the facts, risks, and discomforts that might be expected to influence an individual's decision to willingly participate in a research protocol. This applies to ALL types of research including surveys, interviews, and observations in which participants are identified, and other experiments, such as diet, drug and exercise studies. For a complete list of the components of informed consent that are considered essential by the Cornell IRB, please refer toSOP #10. (/policies/irb-policy-10-informed-consent-options-processes-and-documentation, /sites/default/files/2019-05/SOP%2010%20-%20Informed%20Consent.pdf)\nAre there different types of informed consent? What are they?\nThe informed consent process can take various forms:\nSigned informed consent is the standard expectation in research with human participants. This is in the form of a document with the elements of informed consent, signed and dated by the participant and kept as a record by the researcher.\nIn research with children (individuals under 18 years old), assent of the child and parental permission are standard requirements. Please refer toSOP #11. (/policies/irb-policy-11-research-involving-children, /sites/default/files/2019-05/SOP%2011%20-%20Children.pdf)\nIn some circumstances, investigators can seek alternatives to standard informed consent procedures, such as:A waiver of using a signed consent form (e.g., giving participants an information sheet but not collecting signatures)A waiver of written consent (e.g., using oral consent procedures)A waiver of some or all of the elements of informed consent (e.g., in research that involves deception)\nA waiver of using a signed consent form (e.g., giving participants an information sheet but not collecting signatures)\nA waiver of written consent (e.g., using oral consent procedures)\nA waiver of some or all of the elements of informed consent (e.g., in research that involves deception)\nIt is not uncommon for a research project to involve one or more of the above scenarios. For a complete list of the options for informed consent procedures, and the requirements for approval, please refer toSOP #10. (/policies/irb-policy-10-informed-consent-options-processes-and-documentation, /sites/default/files/2019-05/SOP%2010%20-%20Informed%20Consent.pdf)\nWhat do the terms \"consent\" and \"assent\" mean? Aren't they the same thing?\nBoth consent and assent involve informing potential participants about the research and its risks and benefits, and documenting their understanding and agreement to participate.\nThe reason the different terms are used has to do with the age of the participants. In research involvingadults, \"consent\"is obtained from individuals to participate in the study. In research involving minors, a parent must give permission to allow the child to participate in the research, andchildrenwho are able to understand information about participation are asked to\"assent\"or agree to participate as well.\nDo I always have to obtain the informed consent of research participants?\nThe Cornell IRB is responsible for ensuring that basic ethical principles are abided by in all research. The expectation that the informed consent of research participants be obtained is based upon the Belmont principle of respect for persons, and regarded as extremely important in conducting ethical research. The IRB has the authority to waive some or all of the federal requirements for informed consent in certain extenuating circumstances. A request for waiver of informed consent must be specifically justified by the researcher in the proposal to the IRB.\nWhat is signed informed consent?\nUsed most commonly, signed informed consent allows prospective participants to document their agreement to take part in research activities by signing and dating the consent document.\nDo research participants always have to sign the consent document?\nNot always. In certain situations, the IRB can waive the requirement that you obtain the participant's signature on the consent form.\nWhat is a \"waiver of documentation\" of informed consent?\nA waiver of documentation of informed consent is a request whereby a signed consent document is not required. Examples include implied and verbal consent. Consent will still be obtained from participants; however, they will not be required to sign the consent form. There are only two circumstances when the IRB may waive the requirement to obtain a signed consent form:\nThe only record linking the research participant and the research would be the consent document and the principal risk would be potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality (participant must be asked if he/she want documentation) OR\nThe research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to participants and involves no procedure for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context (for example, no risk surveys or interviews)\nNote: The IRB will take into consideration the risks and potential harms involved in the research and consent process before granting a waiver of documentation of informed consent. In the case of international research, there may be unique cultural or social circumstances that factor into the review process.\nWhat is a \"waiver\" of informed consent? How is it different from a \"waiver of documentation\" of informed consent?\n\"Waiver of documentation of consent\" means a participant may consent by oral or implied consent, versus a \"waiver of informed consent\", which could: (1) alter some or all of the required elements of informed consent, or (2) completely waive the requirement to obtain informed consent (with or without a signature). The IRB may approve a consent procedure which does not include or alters some or all of the required elements of informed consent provided all of the following are true:\nThe research involves no more than minimal risk\nThe waiver of informed consent will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects\nIt is not practicable to conduct the research without the waiver or alteration\nWhenever appropriate, participants will be provided with additional pertinent information after their participation.\nExamples of types of studies in which some or all elements of consent have been waived include retrospective chart reviews, studies of existing pathology specimens, ethnographic research, studies that require deception or passive (opt-out) consent.\nNote: The IRB will take into consideration the risks and potential harms involved in the research before granting a waiver of informed consent. Additionally, there are restrictions for when the IRB may waive the requirements for child assent and parental permission. Please refer toSOP #11for full details. (/policies/irb-policy-11-research-involving-children)\nDo I always have to obtain written permission from parents for children to participate?\nNo. There are two sets of circumstances where the IRB may waive the requirement for parental permission:\nThe first involves research or demonstration projects thatAre conducted by or subject to the approval of state or local government officials and are designed to study, evaluate, or otherwise examine: (i) public benefit or service programs; (ii) procedures for obtaining benefits or services under those programs; (iii) possible changes in or alternatives to those programs or procedures; or (iv) possible changes in methods or levels of payment for benefits or services under those programs; andCould not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration.\nAre conducted by or subject to the approval of state or local government officials and are designed to study, evaluate, or otherwise examine: (i) public benefit or service programs; (ii) procedures for obtaining benefits or services under those programs; (iii) possible changes in or alternatives to those programs or procedures; or (iv) possible changes in methods or levels of payment for benefits or services under those programs; and\nCould not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration.\nThe second involves research thatPoses no more than minimal risk to the children;Would not adversely affect the rights and welfare of children if the IRB approved a waiver or alteration of the requirement for parental permission;Could not be carried out without the waiver or alteration; andWhenever appropriate, would provide the children with additional pertinent information after participation.\nPoses no more than minimal risk to the children;\nWould not adversely affect the rights and welfare of children if the IRB approved a waiver or alteration of the requirement for parental permission;\nCould not be carried out without the waiver or alteration; and\nWhenever appropriate, would provide the children with additional pertinent information after participation.\nI am not collecting any identifying information. Do I still need an informed consent form?\nYes. If the proposed study is truly \"anonymous\" - no collection or use of any identifiers (e.g., names, addresses, phone numbers, signatures, social security numbers, drivers license numbers, etc.) - a modified informed consent form (often called an information sheet) may be used. That is, all of the elements of consent must be documented for the participant, but the signature line is replaced with a statement informing the participant that completion and return of the survey is considered implied consent. If, however, the procedures involve risk or biological sample collections, written consent may be required.\nFor more information about the possibilities for waiver of signed or written informed consent, please refer toSOP # 10. (/policies/irb-policy-10-informed-consent-options-processes-and-documentation, /sites/default/files/2019-05/SOP%2010%20-%20Informed%20Consent.pdf)\nWhat is \"implied\" consent?\nImplied consent is the tacit indication that a person has knowingly agreed to participate in research by performing a research activity or task. By completing the research task (e.g., completion of a questionnaire, interview, survey, etc.), the participant has provided consent to participate in the research.\nImplied consent is actually a type of a waiver of documentation of informed consent. Before granting such a waiver, the IRB may require the researcher to provide the participants with a written summary or an information sheet about the research, including: (1) purpose of research; (2) time involved; (3) assessment of minimal risk; (4) statement regarding benefit to participants; (5) contact for questions about the research; and (6) contact for questions about rights as a research participant.\nThere are a number of instances where this type of consent is helpful. For example, you wish to mail out a survey. The survey does not ask for any identifiable information. The cover letter accompanying the survey could be written in such a manner as to serve as the \"implied\" informed consent form. The letter would need to contain a statement indicating that completion and return of the survey implies consent to participate in the research.\nHow is the consent process handled for internet-based research?\nFor internet-based surveys, it is sometimes appropriate to use implied informed consent. Participants would still need to be presented with the consent information, but would be informed that their consent is implied by submitting the completed survey.\nIf, for study design purposes, the researcher needs to keep track of who participated or if the IRB determines that some sort of documented consent is required, instead of \"signed\" informed consent, the researcher may email the consent form to participants who may then type their name and the date into the spaces provided on the consent form, and return it to the researcher via email. This process may be appropriate for data collected via email, chat rooms, online interviews, etc. Alternatively, some Internet-based survey vendors and/or software packages provide a means to record whether a respondent has consented to participate before beginning a survey (e.g., a date/time stamp feature).\nWhat are the consent requirements for phone-based research?\nFor protocols involving oral consent the following information is required to be communicated to the participant:\nStudy purpose and procedures involved\nWhat will participant be asked to do - as well as the amount of time participant will spend\nThe voluntary nature of participation in the study\nThe participant is free to withdraw at any time\nThe information collected will remain confidential\nOffer the participant contact information for the researcher and/or the IRB\nIt may be pertinent to request the PI to offer additional information depending on the nature of the study. It is up to the IRB Administrator to suggest additional information to be included in order to further protect the participant.\nAre there any sample consent forms or consent form templates available for review?\nReview theForms and Templates pagefor informed consent form templates and guidance. (/forms/irb-consent-form-templates)\n\nTraining-Related Topics\nWhat are the IRB requirements for training?\nAt Cornell University, all investigators and research staff much successfully complete the CITI Program for training in the ethical conduct of research with human participants and update it at least once every five years.\nAdditionally, investigators and research staff must be qualified by training and experience for the research they will be conducting. It is important to understand that the responsibility for the welfare of participants lies with the principal investigator, even when participants have given consent. Investigators and research staff must have the necessary training and expertise to:\nEnsure the rights, welfare and safety of participants are protected\nComply with regulations concerning IRB review and approval, includingInformed consent requirementsReporting requirementsMaintenance and retention of records (keep complete files during and 5 years after research ends)\nInformed consent requirements\nReporting requirements\nMaintenance and retention of records (keep complete files during and 5 years after research ends)\nSupervise research conduct\nApply relevant professional standards that are applicable to the research\nWho is required to complete the IRB human participants training?\nAll faculty, students, and staff proposing to use human participants in research under the auspices of Cornell University are required to complete the IRB human participants training. Approvals for including human participants in proposed research projects will not be granted until this training has been completed and verified by IRB staff. For additional information on this topic, please seeSOP 3. (/policies/irb-policy-3-expedited-and-full-board-reviews-initial-amendment-and-continuing, /sites/default/files/2019-05/SOP%203%20-%20Initial%20and%20Continuing%20IRB%20Review%20Procedures.pdf)\nHow can I take the required training?\nYou can access thehuman participant training online. The IRB may accept alternate training in lieu of the CITI training if the researcher can produce documentation related to the training course/s, the institution offering the training, the date of completion and the score received. Such documentation should accompany the proposal submission or be sent to the IRB office upon request. (/training/citi-online-courses-cornell-researchers-coi-irb-rcr-export-control)\nDoes the IRB Office provide any other training for investigators about the IRB?\nYes. The Institutional Review Board office staff strives to provide information and assistance to investigators and research staff in several ways. The IRB may hold formal seminars to help educate the research community about different IRB and human research topics. Arrangements can also be made to have IRB staff present informational sessions for small groups, which can be tailored for the needs of a specific group.\n\nLifecycle of the Project\nWhen should a modification (amendment) to an approved research study be submitted?\nAny changes to a project that has received IRB approval or exemption must be reviewed and approved before the changes are implemented. Most amendment requests must be submitted throughRASS-IRB; however, forprotocols that received an exemption determinationprior to the implementation of RASS-IRB(which went live on Feb. 1, 2022), amendments can continue to be submitted by sending an email to irbhp@cornell.edu, identifying the protocol (protocol number, title, PI), describing the proposed changes, and attaching any documents that need to be changed, such as consent forms. (https://rass.cornell.edu/irb)\nDo I need to obtain continued approval (renewal) for my research study?\nAnnual continuing review (renewal) is generally required for protocols that received Full Board (Convened Committee) initial review. In some cases, an annual continuing review may also be required for protocols that received Expedited review (e.g., upon a sponsor's request).\nAs a courtesy, several weeks in advance of the expiration date for protocols in need of continuing review, the IRB office will email the PI and any faculty advisor reminding them of the impending expiration. A request for continuing reviewmust be submitted to the IRB viaRASS-IRBa minimum of 4 weeks prior to the expiration date. If the protocol is not granted continuing approval before expiration, all research on the study must cease until continuing approval is granted.

When accepting funds from public sources the University agrees to follow a variety of federal and state regulations and to comply with the terms and conditions set forth by the sponsor.\nThe purpose of this Guide is to provide assistance to faculty and administrative staff with the cost principles as applied at Cornell in order to ensure that proposal budgets are prepared appropriately and the resulting expenditures are properly recorded and consistently classified in all accounting records.\nWhen used in conjunction with thePreparea Proposalpagesof this website,faculty and administrative staff from any University unit (except Weill Cornel Medical College) will have the information necessary to prepare and submit a sponsored project proposal through the the Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP). (/proposal, /proposal, http://www.osp.cornell.edu/ProposalPrep/Prop-guide.html, http://www.osp.cornell.edu/ProposalPrep/Prop-guide.html)\nBudget Considerations\nBudgeting details and requirements vary considerably depending on the sponsor and type of proposal. It is helpful to consider the following questions prior to developing a budget:\n1. What cost principles should be used in budget development?\nAlthough cost principles specifically apply to federally sponsored agreements, the Office of Management and Budget(OMB) Uniform Guidance (UG) (2 CFR 200)(Cost Principles for Educational Institutions) is commonly used to describe the cost principles for all sponsored agreements at Cornell. The tests for appropriateness under these principles are: (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/subtitle-A/chapter-II/part-200)\nReasonableness: A cost may be considered reasonable if the nature of the expenditure and the amount involved reflects the action that a prudent person would take under the circumstances.\nAllocability: A cost is allocable if it is beneficial to the project.\nConsistency: Costs incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances must be treated consistently as either direct or facilities and administrative (F&A) costs. The method used to estimate, record, and report costs must be consistent.\nAllowability: Costs must be allowed in accordance with UG2 CFR \u00a7200.403 Factors affecting allowability of costs, or the terms of the sponsored agreement.

What is the difference between direct and facilities and administrative (indirect) costs?\nDirect costs are costs that can be identified specifically with a particular sponsored project, an instructional activity, or any other institutional activity; or can be directly assigned to such activities relatively easily with a high degree of accuracy. F&A costs are costs that are incurred for common or joint objectives and therefore cannot be identified readily and specifically with a particular sponsored project, an instructional activity, or any other institutional activity.\nAt Cornell direct costs relate to the primary functions or cost objectives of instruction and department research, organized research, and public service. F&A costs consist of expenses relating to the support of the primary functions, including academic administration; University Library operations; plant operations; administrative salaries and expenses of offices such as the President, Provost, Vice Provosts, Human Resources, and Supply Management Services; grant and contract administration and accounting; general expenses including insurance, taxes, and campus security; and depreciation for use of buildings and equipment.\nThe Uniform Guidance (UG) at2 CFR \u00a7200.413 Direct costs, states the salaries and wages of administrative and clerical staff, and non-salary items such as postage for routine correspondence, local telephone calls (including equipment), and routine office supplies should normally be treated as F&A costs and are only appropriate if the purpose of such is for the sole direct benefit of the project. These costs qualify as direct costs when the nature of the performed work constitutes a major program or activity and the costs are specifically identified and justified in the proposal's budget or budget justification section. The costs must be easily identified to the project with a high degree of accuracy. (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/part-200#200.413)\nConsultation with SPS is required to determine if the necessary characteristics exist to create a major program. The examples below are illustrative of what characteristics are included in a major program:\nLarge, complex programs, such as environmental or engineering research centers, and other agreements that entail assembling and managing teams of investigators from numerous institutions.\nProjects involving extensive data collection, analysis and entry, surveying, tabulation, cataloging, searching literature, and reporting.\nProjects that require coordinating travel and meeting arrangements for a large number of participants, such as conferences or seminars.\nProjects where the principal focus is the preparation and production of manuals, large reports, books or monographs (excluding routine progress and technical reports).\nProjects that are geographically inaccessible to normal department administrative services, such as sea-going research vessels, radio astronomy projects, and other remote field sites.\nIndividual projects requiring project-specific database management; individualized graphics or manuscript preparation; human or animal protocol; institutional review board preparations and/or other project-specific regulatory protocols; and multiple project-related investigator coordination and communications.\n3. What are nonrecoverable (unallowable) costs?\nExpenditures for which Cornell may not, by regulation, request reimbursement, either in whole or in part, from the federal government are considered nonrecoverable (unallowable).\u00a0 The Uniform Guidance (UG), in section2 CFR \u00a7200.403 Factors affecting allowability of costs, establishes guidelines on what is an allowable cost on a federally funded project. When preparing a budget the following costs are nonrecoverable and should be excluded: (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/subtitle-A/chapter-II/part-200#200.403)\nAdvertising or public relations: Expenditures to promote the University are nonrecoverable. This includes non-technical newsletters, department publications, and advertising in excess of what is ordinary and necessary. Advertising for the disposal of surplus materials or for employment positions is allowable.\nAlcoholic beverages\nAlumni activities\nBad debts\nCommencement and convocation costs\nDonations or contributions\nDevelopment/fundraising costs\nEmployee morale available only to a select group of employees (e.g., subsidizing coffee for a department) are nonrecoverable. Only costs that are institution-wide are recoverable (e.g., the Employee Day football game and picnic). A department's expenditures incurred for the benefit of their staff are nonrecoverable. However, staff development conferences to which specific staff from a department attend are recoverable.\nEntertainment costs: Costs of entertainment (e.g., tickets to shows or sporting events, meals, lodging, rentals, transportation, and gratuities) are nonrecoverable.\nNote: Business meals (those necessary to carry out the unit's mission) are recoverable with proper documentation and justification. All attendees who claim federal reimbursement must have contributed to the business purpose. Proper documentation includes the date, location, food costs (with an itemization of any alcoholic beverages), attendees, and business purpose. This documentation is also required for Internal Revenue Service purposes. When the number of attendees is large, it is sufficient to name the group rather than each participant (e.g., Engineering faculty).\nExcessive employment recruitment costs (e.g., color advertisements)\nFines and penalties\nGoods or services for personal use (including gifts)\nHousing and personal living expenses\nInvestment management costs\nLobbying costs\nMemberships (including airline clubs)\nMoving costs (if the employee resigns within 12 months)\nStudent activity costs (those activities normally directed by students)\nTravel costs in excess of commercial coach airfare. Costs in excess of the lowest available commercial coach fare are normally nonrecoverable. Exceptions may be granted if unreasonable travel arrangements would result when traveling coach, if the upgrade would decrease the cost, or if it is required to meet the medical needs of the traveler. In order for excess airfare costs to be recoverable the institution must justify and document, on a case-by-case basis, the applicable condition(s), and when required, obtain the sponsor's approval.\nTrustee travel\n4. Will the proposal incorporate cost sharing?\nCost sharing or matching is defined as the portion of project costs not paid by the sponsor. All contributions, including cash and third party in-kind, are acceptable as cost-sharing contributions when they are:\nVerifiable (documented)\nNot included as contributions for any other project\nNecessary and reasonable to accomplish the project's objectives\nAllowable under UG2 CFR \u00a7200.403 Factors affecting allowability of costs (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/subtitle-A/chapter-II/part-200#200.403)\nNot paid for by the sponsor under another award\nProvided for and stated in the approved award\nTheCost Sharing Allowability Matrixshows the allowability of cost sharing by source of funds. (/resources/appendix-e-cost-sharing-allowability-matrix)\nIn addition, federal awards must conform to other provisions as stated inUniform Guidance (UG) (2 CFR 200)(Grants and Agreements With Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Nonprofit Organizations: Uniform Administrative Requirements) or in the sponsored agreement. (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/subtitle-A/chapter-II/part-200)\nExamples of cost-sharing include: the percentage of personnel effort to be expended on the project; associated employee benefits; Graduate Research Assistant tuition; communications; equipment; supplies; and the associated F&A costs. Unrecovered F&A costs (the difference between the full, allowable F&A costs calculated at the current negotiated rate and the F&A costs reimbursed by the sponsor) may be included as part of the cost-sharing or commitment (prior authorization is required by some sponsors). Program income earned under an award may not count as cost sharing unless authorized by the sponsor.\nItems not generally allowed for cost sharing under federal regulations are:\nF&A costs in excess of the 26 percent administrative cap\nSalary dollars in excess of regulatory caps\nCosts incurred prior to the award\nCost overruns\nMany sponsors require cost sharing in the proposal budget or indicate that it is recommended. When cost sharing is recommended it usually means that it will be a factor during proposal evaluation. Cost sharing requirements may be in the form of a specific ratio or stated percentage. The source and categories of the proposed cost sharing commitment should be clearly cited in the budget justification.\nWhen preparing a proposal that incorporates cost sharing it is important to remember that any promised cost becomes part of the project cost; the cost must be tracked, and is subject to audit. Every effort should be made to limit commitments, particularly when not required by the sponsor.\nAfter award acceptance, failure to comply with the cost sharing commitment may result in a loss of funding. Regular tracking of contributions is strongly encouraged, and will prevent under- or over- contribution. Over-contributing might preclude the use of those funds on other projects. Cost sharing should be treated in accordance with Cornell'sCost Sharing Policy. (https://www.dfa.cornell.edu/policy/policies/cost-sharing-sponsored-agreements)\n5. Will the proposal incorporate the use of program income?\nSome sponsored projects may generate income. Program income includes: income from fees for services performed; the sale of commodities or items fabricated under an award; license fees; royalties on patents and copyrights; and interest on loans made with award funds. Interest earned on advances of federal funds is not program income. Except when otherwise provided in federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the award, program income does not include the receipt of principal on loans, rebates, credits, discounts, or interest earned on any part thereof. Program income should be treated in accordance with Cornell'sProgram Income policy. (https://policy.cornell.edu/policy-library/program-income-sponsored-projects)\nSome sponsors require a projection of program income and its intended use at the proposal stage. Calculation of program income should be based on historical information and best projections.\n6. Is the budget being prepared in response to a solicitation?\nSolicitations are used to communicate sponsor requirements to prospective contractors. (For a complete description of the various proposal types, please refer to theAdditional Things to Consider when Preparing a Proposalpage.). A solicitation is a full statement of the work to be performed and may include the requirements of the proposed agreement, including terms and conditions. A proposal is an offer that can be accepted by the sponsor to create a binding agreement either following negotiations or without discussion. (/resources/additional-things-consider-when-preparing-proposal)\nSpecial consideration should be given to a solicitation's terms and conditions. It is important to provide your Grant and Contract Officer (GCO) with a copy of the solicitation at least 10 business days prior to the proposal deadline. There may be budgetary requirements and/or limitations such as total project cost, percentage of effort, equipment needs, explicitly restricted budget categories, required travel, F&A cost limitations, period of performance, or cost-sharing. Adhering to the solicitation's guidelines is crucial, as a specific budget format and level of budgetary detail and/or justification may be required.\n7. Is the proposal on a cost-reimbursement or a fixed price basis?\nA cost-reimbursement agreement provides payment for allowable costs incurred in the performance of the agreement, to the extent prescribed, and establishes estimates of total cost for the purpose of obligating funds and establishing ceilings that Cornell may not exceed. A cost-reimbursement agreement is used when the uncertainties of performance are such that costs cannot be estimated with enough certainty to permit use of a fixed price agreement.\nFixed price agreements set a firm price for the sponsor for which the contractor (e.g., Cornell) bears full responsibility. A definite price is agreed upon before the award, and the price remains fixed for the life of the agreement and is not subject to further adjustment. Fixed price agreements are generally used when reasonably definite specifications, either functional or detailed, are available and when fair and reasonable prices can be estimated and established. Such agreements are usually more restrictive in nature than cost reimbursement agreements, and are tied to a specific task-oriented work statement. Because an absolute limit is imposed on spending, special care is needed when preparing the budget to ensure that the University is in the best possible position to fulfill its proposed obligations. It is especially important to ensure that all reasonable costs are included, since the sponsor is unlikely to reimburse any additional or unforeseen expenditures.\n8. What considerations should be given to the use of small and small disadvantaged businesses and women- and minority-owned businesses?\nWhen working with a federal prime sponsor and the contract or any resultant modifications to the contract are expected to exceed $500,000 ($1 million for construction projects), Cornell is required to submit a subcontracting plan. A small and small disadvantaged business subcontracting plan is a method by which Cornell separately addresses the requirements (in terms of participation and goals) of subcontracting to small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned businesses. Samples and assistance in preparing a subcontracting plan can be obtained from your GCO.\nWhen submitting to a State sponsor Cornell is required, to the extent possible, to utilize women- and minority-owned businesses as subcontractors.\nBudget Preparation\nA proposal must include an estimate that reflects the cost required to perform the work statement and a corresponding budget justification. If a proposal requests support for a multi-year project, annual budgets and a summary budget should be included. Costs for periods beyond the current are called future year projections. Factors to consider in projecting future costs include the salary improvement program, inflation, history, vendor quote projections, professional judgment, experience, and projects that overlap Cornell's fiscal year. Many sponsors provide guidelines and budget forms. Guidance on budget preparation is available from unit administration offices and your GCO. Listed below, by major budget category, are general guidelines for constructing a budget. See\u00a0AppendicesA,B,C,D,\u00a0andEfor samples. (/resources/appendix-sample-budget-format-showing-major-categories, /resources/appendix-b-facilities-and-administrative-fa-cost-calculation-detail, /resources/appendix-c-sample-budget-justification, /resources/appendix-d-sample-budget-conferences-and-seminars, /resources/appendix-e-cost-sharing-allowability-matrix)\nSalaries and Wages\nCompensation for personal services covers all amounts currently paid or accrued by the institution for employee services rendered during the project period. The budget should reflect the estimated percentage of effort (versus hours or months) for professional staff and faculty who will work on the project. Overtime pay eligible staff may be budgeted by providing estimated hours. Salary increases that overlap Cornell fiscal years should be built into the budget. Future years should reflect anticipated increases based on Cornell's salary improvement program. New positions should be budgeted in accordance with the compensation levels and job classifications published by the Office of Human Resources.\nThe costing detail should include names, titles, and percentage of effort. It is not necessary to provide names for other than senior personnel. Part-time employees should be identified as either students or non-students. Percentage of effort for nine-month faculty should be shown separately from summer support. The proposed compensation must be in accordance with sponsor limitations and documentation requirements thereof (e.g., NIH salary cap, NIH limitation on graduate student compensation, NSF limitation on the number of months of summer salary.)\nAcademic Year SalaryFaculty or senior extension associates previously budgeted on University general-purpose or New York State funds may budget a portion of their academic year salary directly to sponsored projects. The salary charged to an agreement during the period of the individual's full-time appointment should not be considered as extra compensation.Salary recovery for a Contract College employee cannot be charged to a New York State-sponsored agreement. Figures should be based on a percentage of estimated effort and budgeted at current salary levels plus reasonable annual increases.\nSalary recovery for a Contract College employee cannot be charged to a New York State-sponsored agreement. Figures should be based on a percentage of estimated effort and budgeted at current salary levels plus reasonable annual increases.\nSummer SalaryFaculty on nine-month appointments may receive additional salary during the summer months up to a maximum of three-ninths of their academic year salary. Summer salary is compensation for work, during the summer, on the particular sponsored agreement. Summer salary funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) for faculty on a nine-month appointment is limited to two-ninths of their regular academic year salary. This limit includes summer salary received from all NSF-funded agreements. The individual must be working on the project while receiving summer salary. Vacation during this period is unallowable. Additionally, nine-month faculty hired to teach full-time during Cornell Summer Session are ineligible to receive additional salary from sponsored agreements during the time (e.g., three, six, or eight weeks) they are teaching. Summer salary is based on the individual's salary for the new Cornell fiscal year.\nSabbatical SupplementsFaculty who take a nine-month sabbatical at half pay may wish to recover all or a portion of the remaining amount of their salary from a sponsored project. Some sponsors will provide academic year supplements to cover all or part of the salary lost during a sabbatical. Endowed sabbatical salaries bear no F&A and employee benefits are charged at the minimum rate. Contract College sabbatical supplements bear neither F&A nor benefits. Note that living allowances for long-term visits (i.e., in excess of 60 days) such as sabbaticals are treated as taxable payments through payroll and are subject to benefit charges as a job-related allowance.\nEmeritus Faculty SalaryEmeritus salaries are based on their last regular salary plus reasonable annual increases.\nVisiting AcademicsIf the visiting academic is a faculty member at another college or university, the appointment should be made at the same professorial level they currently hold. Visiting Fellow should be used if the individual does not currently hold a professorial title. Budgeting for visiting academics should be consistent with departmental appointments and based on the rank of the visitor, plus reasonable annual increases.\nOther ProfessionalsIndividuals included in this category are research and extension associates, technicians, computer programmers and analysts, and academic or extension support aides or specialists. These positions should be budgeted at current salary levels plus reasonable annual increases. Figures should be based on a percentage of estimated effort.\nAdministrative/Clerical StaffStaff responsible for providing coordination and support in the areas of administration, secretarial, personnel, business and/or facilities of an office, department, program, or unit are considered administrative/clerical staff. Direct charging of administrative/clerical salaries on federally supported sponsored agreements is restricted bythe Uniform Guidance (UG)(seeQuestion 2 under Budget Considerations). (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/subtitle-A/chapter-II/part-200, #budgcon)\nThe UG states that the salaries of administrative/clerical staff \"should normally be treated as F&A costs,\" and that the \"direct charging of these costs may be appropriate where a major project or activity explicitly budgets for administrative or clerical services and the individuals involved can be specifically identified with the project or activity.\"\nIf a principal investigator (PI) budgets administrative/clerical salaries, they must be separately itemized with a justification detailing the job duties so they are easily identifiable and assignable to the project with a high degree of accuracy. These positions should be budgeted at current salary levels plus reasonable annual increases. Budget figures should be based on a percentage of estimated effort.\nGraduate Research Assistant (GRA) SupportA GRA is a graduate student who is providing a service to a research effort and is receiving financial support for that thesis or other degree-related work. Payments are made in accordance with pre-established work levels for work performed. Stipend levels are based on the standards established by the Graduate School. Individual Colleges, departments, or fields may establish certain maximums that the student can earn. The tuition portion includes tuition remission and other forms of compensation paid as, or in lieu of, wages. University policy states graduate students receiving full funding from Cornell shall also receive health insurance. Where multiple funding sources are used, the stipend, tuition, and health insurance must be allocated in a similar fashion.\nThe minimum and maximum academic year stipend that may be received and the full academic year and per semester tuition rates for both the endowed and contract colleges is published annually by the Graduate School. The following are links forstipend,tuition, andhealth insurancerates. (https://gradschool.cornell.edu/costs-funding/stipend-rates, https://gradschool.cornell.edu/costs-funding/tuition-and-costs/tuition-rates, https://studenthealthbenefits.cornell.edu/health-plans/shp)\nAll graduate students are charged full tuition. GRAs on sponsored agreements are appointed through the HR system (Workday) with the tuition component paid through the Student Financial System. Cornell funds a portion of tuition in an amount equal to that provided by the grant or contract, regardless of funding source. This will normally result in 50% of the tuition charged to the grant/contract and one-half funded by Cornell.\nProposal budgets should request 50% tuition as the cost per GRA. The amount budgeted for a GRA includes stipend, tuition and health insurance. The stipend should be listed under the salary and wage category and does not incur employee benefits. The tuition and health insurance should be listed under other direct costs and the total should be excluded from MTDC and is not subject to F&A on MTDC-based awards. Departments may choose to show the other half of the tuition cost as institutional cost-sharing. However, once cost-sharing is committed, the obligation must be met in full, even if a graduate student is not appointed to the agreement. Tuition budgets for less than full time assistantships should be prorated across the academic year.\nNote that some USDA sources do not permit the charging of tuition, and in such cases the tuition must be paid with institutional funds.\nStudent WagesUndergraduate students are budgeted at an hourly rate based on their level of expertise and prior experience. These wages are established by Student Employment Services and are excluded from the employee benefits calculation.\nTemporary PersonnelA temporary appointment is a term of employment of at least 20 hours per week and less than six consecutive months. Temporary personnel is budgeted by hourly rates that are consistent with the minimum salary levels established by the Office of Human Resource Services and appropriate to the required level of work and experience.\nEmployee Benefits\nEmployee benefits are part of real employment costs and must be included in a budget. Benefit rates are calculated annually and take effect each July 1. These charges may not be waived. Benefits for salaries and wages in the current fiscal year should be calculated at the current rate. Benefits based on salary estimates for future years or for single year projects that overlap Cornell's fiscal year should be calculated at projected rates.Current and projected benefit rateinformation is available here or may be obtained from your GCO. (/rates/employee-benefit-fringe-rates)\nFor the contract colleges student salaries and wages and sabbatic salaries are exempt from benefit costs. Employee benefits for contract college employees are not calculated on salaries and wages proposed to State (nonfederal flow-through) sponsors. For the endowed colleges the following rate structure is in effect for the categories shown under \"Examples.\"\nEndowed Employee Benefits\nStudent wages (academic year and registered summer)\nBenefits paid directly from the benefit pool (e.g., disability payments)\nVisiting faculty or temporary employees earning less than $5,000 or working fewer than 1,000 hours for all Cornell jobs in a calendar year.\nAll full time employees\nTemporary employees with single or multiple jobs that total 1,000 hours in a calendar year\nTemporary employees with single or multiple jobs that total $5,000 in earnings in a calendar year\nNOTE:When an emeritus professor is appointed with a professorial title, full benefits are charged.\nThe level of costing detail required at proposal submission consists of the amount of salaries and wages, any exclusions, and the corresponding benefit rate(s). Current rate information can be obtained from your GCO or OSP's Web site.\nNote: Employee benefits are charged at the rate in effect at the time of the salary obligation, whether or not the benefits are budgeted at that rate.\nEquipment\nThe capitalization threshold for all equipment for all university operations with a useful life of two years or more is $5,000. This means that an item with a unit cost of $5,000 or more and a useful life of two years or more will be considered capital equipment. Items not meeting these criteria are considered consumable supplies. The capitalization threshold for computer software is $100,000.\nEquipment is subdivided into two classifications: special purpose and general purpose. As a rule, special purpose equipment is considered to be that which is necessary and is strictly limited for use by the research, medical, scientific or other technical activities of a project, and is unlikely to be available within the University.\nGeneral purpose equipment is that for which potential use is not limited to research, medical, scientific or other technical activities. Examples of general purpose equipment include office equipment and furnishings, air conditioning equipment, reproduction and printing equipment, motor vehicles, and data processing equipment. Expenditures for general purpose equipment, buildings, and land are unallowable as direct charges by the federal government and most other sponsors, except where the equipment is primarily for the sole benefit of the project and the expenditure has advance approval from the sponsor.\nThe budget justification page should contain estimates and justification for all equipment needed to perform the scope of work. Such detail should include the necessity and suitability of the equipment, description, unit cost, and any quoted discount. Estimates should be based on either catalog or telephone quotes, historical cost, engineering estimates, or prior experience. Assistance in matters of price, quality and delivery may be obtained from Supply Management Services. Equipment is excluded from the base upon which full F&A costs are calculated and is not subject to the F&A rate.\nSome sponsors will require certification as to the nonavailability or nonexistence on campus of the proposed equipment. After written confirmation from the unit, the GCO will add a statement to the proposal transmittal letter stating such nonavailability.\nFabricated Equipment\nEquipment that is constructed by combining or assembling modular components and/or materials into one identifiable unit is referred to as fabricated equipment. Typically such equipment is made or designed in-house for a specific purpose. In order to be capitalized, the finished product must have a unit cost of $5,000 or more and a life expectancy of more than one year. Shop labor charges related to equipment fabrication by an on-campus shop qualify for inclusion in the capitalized cost and are therefore exempt from F&A cost recovery if:\nThe shop occupies a permanent location and is equipped to provide an ongoing service to a broad spectrum of users; Serves the general research community rather than a single research group or department; Has a billing system for user charges approved by the University Controller; and Shop personnel report to and receive work assignments from a non-academic supervisor.\nShops currently meeting these qualifications are: Laboratory of Atomic and Solid State Physics, Cornell Center for Materials Research, Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-Based Sciences and Education, and Chemistry and Chemical Biology. Other labor costs associated with equipment fabrication are not excluded from F&A cost if the equipment is not fabricated in these Cornell shops. Facilities and administrative costs: F&A costs are calculated on the above components at the full rate.\nThe budget justification page should include the necessity and suitability of the equipment, a description, and the unit cost.\nCommunications\nCommunication costs include telephone services, local and long distance telephone calls, postage (including services such as United Postal Service and Federal Express), and facsimiles. Large mailings of surveys or questionnaires must be identified and justified. These costs should be based on actual experience with an inflation factor built in for future years. On federally funded projects postage for routine correspondence and local telephone costs (equipment, installation, maintenance, line charges, facsimile lines), are treated as F&A costs and are appropriate to budget as direct costs only if the purpose of such is for the sole direct benefit of the project. Such costs must be explicitly budgeted, identified to the project, and justified. Shipment of project materials and deliverables are direct costs if incurred for the sole benefit of the project. Project-associated long distance telephone charges are considered direct costs.\nCertain data communications costs will be considered as F&A costs as follows: expenses associated with backbone/wireless services (e.g., the common infrastructure costs), and port fees, public and non-public.\nNote: It is recognized that a significant portion of the Wide Area Network (WAN) usage is related to and benefits academic activities such as instruction and organized research. Because of this and because WAN usage can be measured it may be apportioned to all benefiting activities, both direct and F&A, proportionate to the benefits provided. In situations where the benefit and apportionment is to a sponsored agreement, the direct charging of these services must be specifically budgeted and justified in the grant application or contract proposal and be approved (or not specifically disapproved) by the awarding agency.\nThe budget justification page should include a listing of the items and a justification and estimated cost for each.\nTravel\nTravel costs are classified as those expenses for transportation, lodging, subsistence and related items incurred by employees who are traveling on official University business. Unless otherwise stated by the sponsor, domestic travel is considered to be travel among any of the 50 United States, its possessions and territories, and Canada. Foreign travel is classified as travel outside these areas. During budget preparation, consideration should be given to expenses for attending professional meetings, field work travel and living allowances, consultation with experts, and meetings required by the sponsor. Travel expenses and requests should be clearly justified and reasonable. The budget should be based on historical data,Cornell's Travel Expenses policy, airline quotes from a travel agency, and sponsor guidelines. (https://policy.cornell.edu/policy-library/travel-expenses)\nTravel in excess of commercial coach airfare is normally nonrecoverable. Foreign travel is a restricted category by most federal agencies and requires prior approval by the sponsor. When costs are charged to a federally sponsored agreement the use of U.S. flag carriers is required.\nThe budget justification page should include the number of trips, the purpose and relationship to the project, and the estimated costs for each trip. For foreign travel the countries to be visited and the visit dates must also be included.\nLease and Rental\nLease and rental expenses for computers and peripheral equipment, general equipment, vehicles, land, buildings, offices and storage areas are included in this category. Lease and rental for space are excluded from the base from which F&A costs are calculated and is not subject to the F&A rate. Budgeting for lease and rental should be based on actual experience with an inflation factor built in for future years, or on actual lease agreements.Procurement and Payment Servicesor theReal Estate Departmentcan provide assistance. (https://www.dfa.cornell.edu/procurement, https://realestate.fs.cornell.edu/)\nThe budget justification page should list the lease or rental item(s) and the estimated cost(s).\nRepair and Maintenance\nRepair and maintenance are categorized as costs incurred for the necessary maintenance, repair, or upkeep of property which neither add to the permanent value of the property nor appreciably prolong its intended life, but keep it in efficient operating condition. Budgeting should be based on actual experience with an inflation factor built in for future years, or from the actual maintenance agreement(s).\nThe budget justification page should include a list of the equipment to be maintained and the estimated costs. To qualify as a direct cost, maintenance costs must be for the sole benefit of the sponsored agreement.\nServices\nUnder this category professional services rendered by Cornell interdepartmental services (e.g., Cornell Business Services, Cornell Information Technologies), outside firms, companies, or individuals should be listed. For interdepartmental services budgets should reflect actual quotes based on current fee structures or anticipated use. Budgeting for external use of services should be based on actual quotes. Assistance in matters of price, quality, and delivery for external sources can be obtained fromProcurement and Payment Services. Both internal departmental and interdepartmental computer charges must be based on accounting and expense systems developed in accordance withUGguidelines and Cornell'sRecharge Entities policy. (https://www.dfa.cornell.edu/procurement, https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/subtitle-A/chapter-II/part-200, https://policy.cornell.edu/policy-library/recharge-entities-ithaca-campus-units)\nThe budget justification page should include a list of the type of service(s), and the total estimated costs.\nAcademic Fees and User Fees\nAcademic recharge operations and service centers may recover the cost of goods and services provided to internal and external users through rates or user fees. User fees should be designed to recover no more than the cost of the service provided, with adjustments based on prior experience. User fees must be calculated consistently for federal and nonfederal users. User fees may not be based on what others charge for similar services, or what Cornell thinks the market will bear. User fees should be based onUGguidelines and Cornell'sRecharge Entities Policy. New user fees for service facilities must be submitted for review and approved by the Controller's Office prior to implementation. User fees for other service facilities must be submitted annually to the Controller's Office for review and approval. Current rates can be obtained by contacting the service provider. (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/subtitle-A/chapter-II/part-200, https://policy.cornell.edu/policy-library/recharge-entities-ithaca-campus-units)\nThe budget justification page should include the rate schedule and calculation of the user fees.\nConsultants\nServices of a consultant may be budgeted when the services are sufficiently special, temporary, or technical in nature that they cannot be performed satisfactorily by existing University personnel during the course of their assigned responsibilities. Consultants are independent contractors, not employees, therefore benefits are not charged. Travel and incidental expenses are included in the total consultant estimate and budgeted under this category. Curriculum vit\u00e6s and other specific information related to the consultant(s) should be maintained by the department. Designation of independent contractor status is governed by the Internal Revenue's Code of Common Law. Cornell may be subjected to significant institutional tax penalties should the individual be incorrectly classified as an independent contractor. Costs should be based on quotes from the consultant. See Cornell'sGuidelines for Consulting Agreements. (https://www.dfa.cornell.edu/procurement/tools-forms/forms/contracts)\nThe budget justification page should include the justification, name, expertise, compensation rate, number of days of expected service, related travel expenses, and the estimated costs.\nNote: Some sponsors may not permit the use of consultants, or may restrict the daily reimbursement rate.\nSubcontracts\nSubcontracts are budgeted when a portion of the required effort needs to be provided by one or more other entities (third parties) which are made responsible for a discrete part of the project. When the portion of effort being performed by a third party constitutes a significant component of the sponsored project, then the third party will be required to provide the resources necessary to conduct that portion of the effort as an independent contractor. The cost(s) normally associated with third party effort could include any or all of the following: labor, employee benefits, materials and supplies, travel, equipment and other direct costs, and F&A costs. In addition, it is not uncommon for third party, commercial organizations to include costs such as labor overhead, material overhead, general and administrative expense, cost of money, and a profit or fee.\nThe budget justification page should include a line itemization at the same level of detail as requested from the sponsor. F&A costs should be included and calculated using the subcontractor's current rate. A copy of the subcontractor's negotiated rate agreement, a statement of intent to participate, and a statement of work should be submitted along with the proposal budget. The reasons for selecting a particular subcontractor should be explained in the proposal.\nThe subcontractor's costs are incorporated into the Cornell budget as a direct cost. When calculating the F&A costs the amount that exceeds $25,000 should be excluded from the base. The first $25,000 of each subcontract, regardless of the length of performance, is calculated at F&A rate effective on the overall award.\nSupplies and Materials\nSupplies and materials are categorized as items actually used in the performance of the work, and all tangible property other than equipment. Incoming transportation charges (freight, bills of lading) are part of material cost. Reasonable amounts should be budgeted, and projects that anticipate using large amounts or expensive items should specify such items and justify their necessity. Budgeting should be based on actual experience with an inflation factor built in for future years. Assistance in matters of price, quality, and delivery can be obtained fromProcurement and Payment Services. (https://www.dfa.cornell.edu/procurement)\nOn federally funded projects routine office supplies should be treated as F&A costs and are only appropriate to budget as direct costs if the purpose is for the sole direct benefit of the project. These direct costs must be explicitly budgeted, specifically identified to the project, justified and approved by the sponsor. Laboratory supplies (chemicals, glassware, disposables), animals (purchase, shipping, housing, maintenance), research supplies and training materials (questionnaires, surveys) are considered direct costs. Care should be taken to explicitly describe all consumables included in a proposal budget. For example, computer forms should not be budgeted as office supplies.\nThe budget justification page should include a list of the supplies and the estimated costs for each. The breakdown should be more detailed when the total supplies cost is substantial.\nConferences and Seminars\nWhen hosting a conference or seminar, appropriate costs include meals, transportation, facilities rental, and other related items. When budgeting for a conference or seminar, some considerations are:\nEmployee salaries and benefits: Salaries of professional personnel, editorial, clerical, and other staff are allowable in proportion to the time and effort devoted to the preparation and conduct of the event and summarizing its results. To the extent possible, costs should be based on actual salaries and benefit rates.\nNon-participants: Reasonable fees (in the form of honoraria), travel allowances, and per diem are allowable for cost of services (e.g., presenters) rendered by persons who are members of a particular profession or who possess a special skill and are not employees or participants.\nFacility rental: Rental of facilities and necessary equipment are allowable and budgets should be based on quotes from the service provider.\nConference materials: Necessary expendable materials and supplies are allowable and estimates should be based on actual experience with an inflation factor built in for future years.\nPublications: Cost of publishing the proceedings are allowable only if approved by the sponsor. Projections should be based on actual experience with an inflation factor built in for future years.\nFacilities and administrative costs: F&A costs are calculated on the above components at the full negotiated rate.\nParticipants: Participants are the individuals whose primary interest is as beneficiaries of the event. Participants may make formal presentations or give papers. If a participant is a federal employee, he or she may not be receiving compensation from other government sources while participating in the event. The following associated costs are excluded from the F&A cost base:\nStipend: Participants may receive a stipend to help defray living expenses while participating in a conference. Allowances should be budgeted at a reasonable rate and are limited to the days of attendance plus actual travel time.\nTravel, per diem, or subsistence: Reasonable travel allowances related to the conference or training activity (e.g., field trips) may be budgeted.\nRegistration fees: Registration fees are treated as program income to offset the costs of the event. Fees should be established based on total program costs including both the direct and F & A program costs and divided by the number of expected participants. A registration fee paid to or on behalf of a participant is treated as a direct participant cost. For disposition of program income, refer to the Cornell'sPolicy on Program Income. (https://policy.cornell.edu/policy-library/program-income-sponsored-projects)\nThe budget justification page should include an itemization of the above categories and the estimated costs of each. SeeAppendix Dfor a sample budget format. (/resources/appendix-d-sample-budget-conferences-and-seminars)\nPublications\nPublication costs consist of the documenting, preparing, publishing, disseminating, and sharing of project findings and supporting material. Budgeting should be based on actual experience with an inflation factor built-in for future years. Assistance may be obtained from Procurement Services or by contacting a publisher. (https://www.dfa.cornell.edu/procurement/about/contact)\nThe budget justification page should include the page charges, the number of pages, and the estimated cost.\nFacilities and Administrative Cost\nThe facilities and administrative cost rate is an accounting mechanism used by universities to recover real support costs that benefit sponsored projects but cannot readily be associated with specific projects. The university infrastructure supports programs by providing such items as the physical plant, libraries, some level of departmental and central administration, and sponsored programs administration. The process for recovery is a reimbursement of actual expenditures, calculated in accordance with2 CFR \u00a7200.414 Indirect (F&A) costsof the Uniform Guidance (UG). The University is subject to government internal and external audit of supporting data for every year. The F & A cost rate is an average of all F&A costs incurred for all federal and non-federal funded projects. (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/part-200#200.414)\nAt Cornell, an F&A cost rate is applied to all restricted accounts for all awards regardless of whether they are categorized as a gift, grant, or contract. In practice, F&A cost is applied as follows: whenever a sponsor is the primary beneficiary, or receives specific deliverables expressed as either one or more of the four conditions shown in the top left box, it is appropriate that the sponsor pay for the full cost, both direct and F&A. If the award does not provide for any of these conditions, it is still appropriate to charge the full F&A cost. However, the recovery rate may be discounted, but never below ten percent of direct costs, excluding student wages or tuition. In this manner every project supports a portion of Cornell's infrastructure.\nApplication of Facilities and Administrative Cost Rates\nFacilities and Administrative (F&A) Costs are applied as described in the table below for all awards, regardless of whether they are referred to by the sponsor as a Gift, Grant, or Contract.\nHardware, software, instructional or research data deliverables (other than routine reports).\nLicense to intellectual property (Patents or Copyrights).\nTraining or other services (including testing) performed primarily for the benefit of the sponsor.\nInput or joint determination of the research effort during performance such as in a cooperative agreement.\n\nFull Facilities and Administrative Cost RatesThe University negotiates F&A cost rates with its cognizant federal agency. Separate rates are negotiated for the endowed and contract divisions. These rates are further subdivided into on-campus, off-campus, and research and educational services.\nModified Total Direct Cost (MTDC)The MTDC is the base upon which the F&A cost rate is calculated and applied. The MTDC represents total direct costs less certain modifiers. Modifiers are categories of direct costs, identified by object codes, which are excluded from the base and not subject to F&A costs. The list of modifiers include: GRA tuition, fees and health insurance, capital equipment (including fabricated equipment and lease/purchase agreements), lease and rental (real property), and subcontract expenditures in excess of $25,000.\nOn-campus versus Off-campus\nProjects are normally budgeted as solely on-campus or solely off-campus. Some projects may, however, involve both. The definition of off-campus activity is that which is performed at a location that has neither the use nor aid of owned or leased University-operated facilities. A University-operated facility is one where Cornell is responsible for the costs of maintenance, custodial services, and utilities. In general, off-campus locations are at distances where reasonable access to or use of the University-owned or operated facilities is not feasible. Personnel are considered to be on-campus unless they are working off-campus for a continuous period of two months or longer. The two-month requirement does not apply to individuals on sabbatical. Costs generated by personnel working off-campus, including their travel to and from the off-campus location, can be budgeted as off-campus.\nResearch versus Educational ServicesThe research rate is used for all projects intended to produce research outcomes. The educational services rate is applied to expenditures for all activities that are part of Cornell's instruction program or other non-instruction services other than research. Activities such as community service programs and cooperative extension services are included in the educational service rate.\nCurrent Facilities and Administrative Rate information is availablehereor may be obtained from your GCO.

Cornell PD PaLS offers Cornell-internal funding (up to $10,000 per applicant) when postdoctoral researchers require leave or other work adjustments for the birth or adoption of a child.\nPD PaLS is co-funded by the Office of the Vice President for Research & Innovation (OVPRI) and colleges with 50% cost-shared between OVPRI and the college of the postdoc's faculty mentor, up to 10 slots per year. Proposals are developed jointly by the postdoc and the faculty mentor; the provisioned funding is distributed to the postdoc mentor because the use period generally occurs during the postdoc leave period.\nProgram Eligibility\nThe PD PaLS program provides financial assistance (up to $10K per applicant) when postdoctoral researchers require leave or other work adjustments for the birth or adoption of a child, allowing the project team to adapt during the postdoc\u2019s extended absence. Eligibility includes those on parental leave throughAcademic Medical Leave and/or Federal Family and Medical Leave (FMLA).\nThe preferred use of program fundsis for those working on sponsored projects and programs who can provide clear evidence of need,allowing the project team to adapt during the postdoc\u2019s leave period.\nThis program is for postdoctoral associates working in Ithaca-based departments.\nContact: Questions about the Cornell PD PaLS program should be directed to Sally Blinn(sgb93@cornell.eduor 607-255-7200), Senior Administrative Assistant and Event Coordinator in OVPRI. ((sgb93@cornell.edu)\nHow to apply: Faculty mentors may apply to this program and should coordinate the application with their postdoctoral associate. Postdoctoral associates should not apply directly to the program. It is expected that the faculty mentor will submit the application after consultation with the postdoctoral associate.\nTiming: Applications will be accepted on a rolling basis. However, award notifications will be announced quarterly, with reviews conducted in March, June, September, and December.\nNOTE: During the first review period with awards announced by or in December 2024, there will be rolling awards to allow participation for those not previously aware of the new quarterly award structure. Starting in 2025, applications will be compiled and considered on the quarterly basis to allow mindful assessment of needs in balance with limited funds to award.\nSally Blinn - Senior Administrative Support and Event Coordinator (/contacts/sally-blinn-senior-administrative-support-and-event-coordinator)\nFind Your Next Funding Opportunity (/proposal/Find-Your-Next-Funding-Opportunity)\nUpstate New York Energy Storage Engine (/resources/upstate-new-york-energy-storage-engine)\nFunding Opportunity: Bezos Earth Fund Grand Challenge (/resources/funding-opportunity-bezos-earth-fund-grand-challenge)\nFoundation Funding (/resources/foundation-funding)\nLimited Submissions Funding Opportunities (/resources/limited-submissions-funding-opportunities)\nRecurring and Prestigious Funding Opportunities (/resources/recurring-and-prestigious-funding-opportunities)\nFaculty Recognition Prizes and Awards (/faculty-awards)\nInternal Funding for Faculty, Postdocs & Students (/resources/internal-funding-faculty-postdocs-students)\nEarly Career Faculty Research Funding (/resources/early-career-funding)\nGrants for Women and Underrepresented Communities (/resources/grants-women-and-underrepresented-communities)\nQuick Reference\nRates (/rates)\nForms (/forms)\nPolicies (/policies)\nContacts (/contacts)\nTraining (/training)\nEvents (/events)\nNews & Announcements (/news)\n\u00a9 2019 Cornell University\nWeb Accessibility Help (mailto:rais-help@cornell.edu?subject=researchservices.cornell.edu%20site)"

(/resources/overview-costs-project-budgets-budget-and-costing-guide)\nWhen responding to an RFP or RFQ with the proposed terms and conditions stated in the solicitation the investigator should notify and forward a copy of the solicitation to their GCO as far in advance of the deadline as possible.\nTheForm10 (Proposal Routing and Approval Form)must accompany every proposal submitted to OSP. Form 10 provides OSP with information on where to submit the proposal and identifies what compliance issues exist and what institutional resources are required for the project. Investigators are responsible for completing Form 10 and, by signing it, accept full responsibility for the project. The proposal and Form 10 should be received by OSPat least five business daysbefore the proposal deadline. Investigators are strongly urged to coordinate their proposal schedule with Development/OSP as soon as the proposal deadline is known. (/forms/rass-form-10-phased-out, /forms/rass-form-10-phased-out)\nOccasionally a sponsor may require an institutional cover letter or letter of support from the President or Provost. These proposals should be received by OSPat least 10 business days before the deadline. In addition to the required internal review, extra time is necessary to obtain a signature due to the President's and Provost's extensive travel schedules.\nDepartment/Unit Responsibilities\nMany departments have administrative staff who can offer proposal preparation assistance in the areas of:\nProposal editing;\nBudget preparation and proper costing;\nIdentifying accounts for matching funds or cost-share contributions;\nProviding logistical support for items such as space and personnel;\nAssisting the investigator in complying with any relevant special reviews;\nCoordinating documentation for subcontracts and/or consultants;\nPreparing certifications and representations for signature by OSP;\nPhotocopying the final proposal (number of copies required by sponsor plus one copy for the department and one copy for OSP; and\nCoordinating department chair/unit/Center director signature(s) for Form 10\nThe Pre-Award Research Operations (PRO) team in OSP offers proposal preparation assistance to researchers from the College of Engineering\nCollege/Center Responsibilities\nEach College or Center is responsible for ensuring that major commitments of resources are appropriate for a project. Colleges and units with policies regarding proposal approval may wish to sign the Form 10 to ensure that the appropriate commitments have been made. OSP should be notified when a unit's proposal routing policy changes.\nOffice of Sponsored Programs Responsibilities\nOSP is available to assist as needed the investigator and/or unit in any phase\u00a0 of proposal preparation. Proposals are carefully reviewed to ensure that they comply with all University, federal, and/or state requirements, and are prepared in such a way as to meet with favorable reviews during competition. Proposals are reviewed for the following criteria:\nProposal format and content comply with sponsor guidelines;\nBudget reflects adequate resources and costing detail to accomplish the project and complies with federal regulations;\nReview of the Form 10 for appropriate signatures and investigator compliance with relevant special reviews;\nVerification of cost-share commitments and/or matching funds;\nVerification of documentation for subcontractors and/or consultants; and\nReview and signature of certifications and representations.\nOSP then prepares a transmittal letter and submits the proposal.\nInvestigators should notify their GCO as soon as possible when responding to an RFP, RFQ, or other type of solicitation. In order to be responsive to a solicitation, all conditions must be met or otherwise qualified in a transmittal letter. Usually a solicitation will state the proposed terms and conditions for any resulting award, but if the conditions are unacceptable to Cornell the GCO must address these conditions and explain the University's position. The research, preparation, and documenting of a response requires five business days and can not be left to the last minute.\nA revised budget and work statement may be necessary if a sponsor notifies OSP or the investigator that the funds available for a program vary substantially from the proposed budget. Consideration should be given to whether the scope of work is of such a specific nature that reduced funding would seriously affect the accomplishment of the proposed objectives. A revised proposal is reviewed by OSP in the same manner as a new proposal, and should be receivedat least five business days before the deadline.\nOSP has delegated limited transaction authority toCALS Office of Sponsored Researchand theCVM Research Officeto review and submit proposals to certain sponsors. All other proposals must be submitted to OSP.

Here we provide information about record retention requirements and Cornell resources to help you manage this process.\nRequirements for Data and Records Retention\nResearch records must be retained in university facilities, unless the Vice Provost for Research grants specific permission to do otherwise. Beyond any required period of retention, the destruction of research records is at the discretion of the PI, according to college or department policy, or the norms of their field.\nSponsored Projects\nUnderCornell University Policy 4.7, \"Retention of University Records\",grant and contract proposals, awards, agreements and supporting documentation must be retained for the following lengths of time: (https://www.dfa.cornell.edu/policy/policies/retention-university-records)\nNew York State projects: 6 years after close of grant\nFederal projects: 3 years after close of grant\nIndustry, Foundation, and Non-Profit projects: retention lengths can vary, and are dictated by the terms of the specific agreement\nAnimal Research (IACUC)\nThe collection, retention, and sharing of data related to research involving vertebrate animals must comply withCornell University Policy 1.4, \u201cCare and Use of Live Vertebrate Animals in Research and Teaching,\u201das well as all applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulations, policies, and guidelines. Contact theIACUC officefor more information. (https://www.dfa.cornell.edu/policy/policies/care-and-use-live-vertebrate-animals-research-and-teaching, /offices/iacuc)\nHuman Participant Research (IRB)\nCollection, retention, and sharing of research data involving human participants must comply withCornell Institutional Review Board (IRB) policies, as well as all applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulations, policies, and guidelines. Contact theIRB officefor more information. (https://researchsupport.cornell.edu/policies?f%5B0%5D=office%3A2611, /offices/IRB)\nSpecial Circumstances\nAny of the following circumstances may justify longer periods of retention:\nIf the terms of a sponsored research agreement require a longer retention period;\nIf theCenter for Technology Licensingdeems retention is required to protect intellectual property; (/offices/ctl)\nIf any allegations regarding the research arise, such as academic misconduct or conflict of interest. Research data must be retained until such allegations are fully resolved;\nIf a legal action, investigation, or official inquiry related to the research is ongoing, research data must be retained until such issues are fully resolved.\nDocument Management and Storage Resources at Cornell\nCornell Data Services (https://data.research.cornell.edu/)\nData Storage Finder (https://finder.research.cornell.edu/storage)\nManaging restricted access data sets:Cornell Restricted Access Data Center (CRADC) (https://ciser.cornell.edu/data/secure-data-services/cradc/)\nDisposal of Biological Materials and Lab Waste\nFor information about safe and compliant disposal, visit:\nCornellBiological Safety website (https://sp.ehs.cornell.edu/lab-research-safety/bios/Pages/default.aspx)\nCornellRegulated Medical Waste Program (https://sp.ehs.cornell.edu/lab-research-safety/waste/regulated-medical-waste/Pages/default.aspx)\nUniversity Policy 4.7, Retention of University Records (https://www.dfa.cornell.edu/policy/policies/retention-university-records)\nProject Closeout (/close-project/how-to)\nSubaward Closeout (/resources/subaward-closeout)\nEquipment Transfers (/resources/equipment-transfers)\nComplete and Submit Invention Disclosure (/resources/complete-and-submit-invention-disclosure)\nQuick Reference\nRates (/rates)\nForms (/forms)\nPolicies (/policies)\nContacts (/contacts)\nTraining (/training)\nEvents (/events)\nNews & Announcements (/news)\n\u00a9 2019 Cornell University\nWeb Accessibility Help (mailto:rais-help@cornell.edu?subject=researchservices.cornell.edu%20site)"

Only mandatory (i.e., required) cost share is to be included, quantified in a sufficient manner as to adhere to the solicitation requirements.\nQuantified cost share, reflected in the proposal budget or budget justification, is a binding commitment and must be accounted for in accordance with university policy.\nContributions not quantified in the proposal budget or budget justification (i.e.,voluntary uncommitted) are non-binding commitments and do not require documentation or reporting.\nAllowable Expenses\nExpenses eligible for cost share must be consistent with terms and conditions of the agreement.\nCost share expenses:\nMust be reasonable, necessary and allocable to the projectallowable as a direct costcannot be considered a normally indirect cost (included in F&A rate)\nallowable as a direct cost\ncannot be considered a normally indirect cost (included in F&A rate)\nMust be within the period of performance\nCannot be used for multiple commitments\nIs Cost Share Required?\nReview agreement documentation to identify cost share commitments. In the case of Voluntary Committed cost share, review the proposal budget or budget justification.\u00a0 Cost share commitments are typically reviewed and approved institutionally before the proposal is submitted and should not be a surprise upon receiving the award.\nIdentifying Cost Share Requirement\nThe following identifiers are found in applications most commonly use at Cornell and are populated based on sponsored agreement documentation.\nNote:If the agreement documentation does not correspond to the data presenting in any of the tools you use, please contact the appropriateSource Accountant.

Waived indirect costs can only be used to meet a cost share commitment upon approval by the sponsoring agency although prior approval is automatically granted in some circumstances. (https://www.dfa.cornell.edu/capitalassets/cost/facilities)\nNew York State Benefits\nMost contract college accounts are not charged benefits directly and the Labor Benefit Rate Category on those accounts is CC (Contract College). If NYS benefits are utilized as a match component, those entries will not be recorded in the general ledger. This is a calculation of the benefits that would be expensed directly to the project based on the appropriateEmployee Benefit Rates. (https://www.dfa.cornell.edu/capitalassets/cost/employee)\nExternal Commitments\nA subcontractor may be required to contribute to the project\u2019s cost share. External commitments are not recorded in our general ledger and must be monitored by the unit throughout the life of the project. This is generally conducted through review of the subcontract\u2019s financial report.\nIn-kind contributions require documentation to indicate the level of support provided, and the value of the services/donated items. Valuation must be consistent with that described in Uniform Guidance2 CFR 200.306. (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/subtitle-A/chapter-II/part-200#200.306)\nRelevant Policies\nUniversity Policy 1.1, Cost Sharing for Sponsored Agreementsoutlines critical guidance on cost share. Given that cost share generally comprises institutional funds, it\u2019s important to understand the risks and requirements related to managing this activity. (https://www.dfa.cornell.edu/policy/policies/cost-sharing-sponsored-agreements)\nFederal requirements are outlined in Title II of the Code of Federal Regulation, Part 200 - Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards.

On occasion, a portion of the required effort may be provided by one or more other institutions or companies (third parties) who are made responsible for a discrete part of the project. When the portion of effort to be performed by a third party constitutes a substantive component of the \u201cscience\u201d of the sponsored award, the third party is required to provide the resources and personnel necessary to conduct that portion of the work as an independent entity.\nCosts normally associated with third-party efforts could include any or all of the following:\nLabor\nEmployee benefits\nMaterials and supplies\nTravel\nEquipment\nConsultants\nOther direct costs\nFacilities and administrative costs (indirect costs)\nNote: In the for-profit sector, it is common to include costs such as labor overhead, material overhead, general and administrative (G&A) expense, and a profit or fee.\nIf a sponsored award involves issuing subawards for physical construction of facilities or renovation of existing facilities, the Facilities Services Division, Facilities Contracts Department (607) 255-3982\u00a0must be contacted prior to submission of the proposal to ensure compliance with the Board of Trustees and university administrative procedures and to ensure that necessary approvals are obtained.\nThe Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP) is available to assist departments in these procedures and would be involved in assisting Facilities Contracts in the preparation of any subaward.Contact your GCOif you have questions or need assistance related to the inclusion of a subaward in your proposal. (/gco)\nSubaward Relationship\nSubaward agreement: The document that OSP generates to formalize a third-party relationship with another organization to perform substantive work based upon an award made to Cornell.\nSubrecipient: The third party performing the effort under a subaward agreement.\nWhat is NOT a Subaward\nActivities performed by a third party that do not constitute a substantive portion of the work effort of the project, are not unique or may be obtained competitively in a commercial environment, or are not performed independently and with decisions making authority are not obtained using a subaward and should be contracted for using either a consulting agreement or a purchase order.\nWhen such activities are performed by an individual under a sponsored award, they are administered through a consulting agreement issued by Supply Management Services. A purchase order must be used when purchased services may involve an organizational entity. For example, a purchase order would be appropriate for the performance of repetitive tests or activities requiring little or no discretionary judgment on the part of the provider. In these instances, a consulting agreement or a purchase order may be issued through the normal Cornell Procurement process.\nFor help in determining if you are working with a Subrecipient or a Contractor, this document can be utilized:Subrecipient vs Contractor Checklist (/sites/default/files/2022-11/Subrecipient%20vs%20Contractor%20Checklist.pdf)\nSubrecipient Selection\nSponsor or peer-reviewed.If the subrecipient is specified in the proposal and the collaboration is funded, it is not necessary to comply with the procurement requirements for competitive bidding or sole source justification because the sponsor or peer review process already approved the selection.\nNon-sponsor or non-peer reviewed.It is the responsibility of the Cornell Principal Investigator (PI), along with OSP, to comply with procurement requirements of the sponsor in selecting a subrecipient. There are two methods of selecting a subrecipient: competitive bidding or sole source procurement. Competitive bidding is the preferred method of subrecipient selection. This method requires OSP, in conjunction with the PI, to solicit proposals from a number of sources and make a final selection of a subrecipient from those responding based on technical merit and cost objectives, normally the lowest price from a technically qualified respondent.\nSole source justification.When the procurement requires performance from a specific entity because services or expertise are unique or not available from other sources, the PI is required to provide sole source justification, identifying the need for the services and why the selected subrecipient\u00a0is the only source available for the needed services.\nSole source selection is not justified simply by the fact that there has been an ongoing collaboration between the researchers and the potential subrecipient. It must be further justified with reasons for the unavailability of the services or expertise from other sources.\nSubaward Proposal\nIf a Cornell PI plans to include another institution in an upcoming proposal where such institution will be expected to perform a substantive portion of the effort, a number of documents must be obtained from the proposed subrecipient prior to submission of the proposal to the sponsor:\nASubrecipient Commitment Formor (for FDP Partner entities) anFDP Institutional Letter of Commitment (ILOC)signed by the Subrecipient\u2019s Authorized Organizational Official confirming the organization\u2019s commitment to participate in the project, commit resources, and abide by the prime sponsor\u2019s associated terms and conditions (https://researchservices.cornell.edu/forms/subcontractor-commitment-form, https://researchservices.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/2022-05/FDP%20ILCO%20%281%29.pdf)\nStatement of work\nBudget\nBudget Justification \u2013 Optional, but highly recommended. This allows Cornell to determine if the budgeted expenses are justified for the work the subrecipient will complete.\nA copy of the subrecipient\u2019s most recent negotiated indirect cost rate agreement (NICRA) for non-FDP subrecipients. For FDP subrecipients, the NICRA is obtained from theFDP Expanded Clearinghouse. (https://fdpclearinghouse.org/)\nAny other documents required by the prime sponsor (ex. Biographical sketches, equipment, facilities, current and pending, conflict of interest forms, etc.)\nThere must be adequate time provided between the receipt of a subrecipient's proposal and the sponsor's proposal due date, to allow Cornell's PI sufficient time to discuss and negotiate the statement of work, the unit administrator to review the subrecipient\u2019s budget and letter of commitment and for the OSP to review the subrecipient\u2019s documents.\nIncluding a Subaward in a Proposal Budget\nThe budget should be itemized by major budget category, such as salaries and wages, employee benefits, supplies, equipment, travel, consultants, other direct costs, and facilities and administrative (F&A) costs in a fashion similar to that required by the prime sponsor.\nMore specific itemization of budget categories may be needed if required by the sponsor.\nThe subrecipient's budget is included in Cornell's budget as a direct cost. When calculating Cornell's F&A costs, the amount that exceeds $25,000 of each subaward should be excluded from the calculation, in accordance with2 CFR 200 Uniform Guidance (UG). F&A costs on the first $25,000 is calculated using the on-campus rate applicable to the award.

For more information about Cornell IRB training requirements, visit theIRB Training webpage. (/news/nih-policy-change-new-data-management-and-sharing-policy, /news/irb-news-new-training-requirement-exempt-research, /resources/irb-training)\nThis page containsinformationfor researchers and research participants on how and when to report something unexpected in connection with a Cornell research project involving human participants.\nFor Researchers - how and when to report a protocol deviation or unexpected event\nReporting an Unanticipated Problem/Adverse Event\nPrincipal Investigators (PIs) must promptly report to the IRB anyinjuries or other unanticipated problems involving risks to human participants or othersthat occur in connection with a Cornell research project. An unanticipated problem involving risk to human participants or others is one that: (1) was unforeseen at the time of its occurrence, and (2) indicates that participants or others are at an increased risk of harm. One type of unanticipated problem is an \"adverse event,\" referring to an instance where a participant is harmed in the course of participating in the research.\nThe IRB staff encourages researchers to report such problems as soon as possible. As soon as possible the PI shouldfill out an Adverse Event reporton their RASS-IRB protocol. When in doubt about whether and what information to report to the IRB, please discuss the issue with a member of theIRB staff. (https://guide.rass.cornell.edu/institutional-review-board-for-human-participant-research/submit-an-adverse-event/, /offices/IRB)\nReporting a Protocol Deviation\nA protocol deviation (also referred to as protocol \"noncompliance\") occurs whenresearch involving human participants is conducted in a manner that disregards or violates federal regulations,the policies or procedures of the Cornell IRB, or a research protocol as it was approved or exempted by the Cornell IRB or IRB staff. Even in the absence of any ill intent, an unapproved or otherwise noncompliant research activity may place a research participant at unnecessary risk.\nThe IRB may become aware of information indicating noncompliance from a participant, researcher, Cornell employee, or member of the public; from the interpretation of information received during the protocol submission and review process; from the findings of a random or for-cause audit or other quality control activities; or from the PI or member of the research team directly. Depending on the facts and circumstances, the IRB may require the PI toreport the Protocol Deviationin RASS-IRB.

You may get in touch with the Principal Investigator for the study using the contact information given during the informed consent process.\nIf your concern is more grave, or if you prefer to have a third party work with you to investigate and resolve your complaint, contact theIRB office. Please include enough information so that the IRB staff can conduct an investigation and take appropriate action. The title of the study in question and name of the researcher with whom you worked are key information that the IRB will need from you.

Generally, we should allocate costs consistently with how they have been historically managed. The treatment of these costs must reasonably follow our disclosed costing practices, along with the principles set forth inSubpart E of 2 CFR 200, which states that for a cost to be allowable it must be: (https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=704835d27377ef5213a51c149de40cab&node=2:1.1.2.2.1&rgn=div5#sp2.1.200.e)\nReasonable\nNecessary for the performance of the award\nConsistent with policies and procedures that apply uniformly to both contract and grant funds and other university funds\nConsistently treated, across like circumstances, as a direct cost\nIn accordance with Cornell policy, agency regulations, and the federal uniform guidance\nIn compliance with accounting principles and award period of performance\nAllocable, as follows:Specifically to the awardBenefits both an award and other work, and can be distributed in proportions that may be approximated using reasonable methodsIf a cost benefits two or more projects or activities in proportions that can be determined without undue effort or cost, the cost must be allocated to the projects based on the proportional benefit.If a cost benefits two or more projects or activities in proportions that cannot be determined because of the interrelationship of the work involved, then the costs may be allocated or transferred to benefitted projects on any reasonabledocumentedbasis.\nSpecifically to the award\nBenefits both an award and other work, and can be distributed in proportions that may be approximated using reasonable methodsIf a cost benefits two or more projects or activities in proportions that can be determined without undue effort or cost, the cost must be allocated to the projects based on the proportional benefit.If a cost benefits two or more projects or activities in proportions that cannot be determined because of the interrelationship of the work involved, then the costs may be allocated or transferred to benefitted projects on any reasonabledocumentedbasis.\nIf a cost benefits two or more projects or activities in proportions that can be determined without undue effort or cost, the cost must be allocated to the projects based on the proportional benefit.\nIf a cost benefits two or more projects or activities in proportions that cannot be determined because of the interrelationship of the work involved, then the costs may be allocated or transferred to benefitted projects on any reasonabledocumentedbasis.\nAdequately documented\nItems required by all individuals occupying campus, such as facemasks should not be directly charged to projects, unless that was a specific project need prior to the COVID-19 emergency. Costs that are specifically identified to a project \u2013 especially where historically borne by such projects \u2013 such as gloves, eye protection, or respirators should continue to be charged directly to the benefitting project(s). Costs that are necessary for the safe use of a laboratory, such as barriers, may be considered similarly to laboratory supplies or equipment and charged directly where allocable. Proper allocation means that where multiple activities benefit from the expense that the cost is allocated across all of them. Consistent treatment of such costs across the campus is important, meaning that if treated as direct costs in research labs, they must also be treated as direct costs in instructional labs.\nBelow are some examples.

The members of the bargaining unit are teaching assistants, graduate research assistants, research assistants, and graduate assistants at the Ithaca, Geneva, and Cornell Tech campuses.\nThe university hasbegunthe process of collective bargaining with the UE. (https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2024/04/contract-negotiations-begin-between-cornell-union-representing-graduate-assistants)\nThe university has assembled resources on theGraduate Assistant Unionization Update websiteto answer questions faculty and staff may have about unionization, the bargaining process, \u201cterms and conditions\u201d of employment, and related matters.\u00a0Below are selected FAQs relevant to research continuity planning. You can find the full list of FAQs at theGraduate Assistant Unionization Update website.Guidance on steps that faculty may take to support research continuity are available atResearch Continuity During Unexpected InteruptionsandFaculty Contingency Planning Resources. Faculty seeking additional advice may reach out by email tofaculty colleagues in Research & Innovation. (https://unionupdate.gradschool.cornell.edu/, https://unionupdate.gradschool.cornell.edu/, /news/research-continuity-during-unexpected-disruptions, https://unionupdate.gradschool.cornell.edu/welcome/strike-guidance-and-staffing/faculty-resources/, /offices/ovpr)\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow many hours per week should graduate assistants devote to their studies? To their assistantship duties?\nAll graduate students in research degrees are considered to be full time students and are enrolled in 12 credits of coursework and/or research. By Cornell and New York state standards, 12 credits equates to 36 hours academic activity.\u00a0This is a baseline expectation. Of course, many students invest much more time into their own studies. Students should have full-time engagement in academic duties that are developmental for their own training as a scholar and in furtherance of a degree.\nWhen a full-time student holds an assistantship position, the time commitment is 15 hours per week on average, with no week to exceed 20 hours.\u00a0That rule is in place, in part, to ensure that students are not performing excessive service work for the university that slows their own degree progress.\nIf a graduate student in the RA, GRA or GA categories, who are funded by faculty grants, decide to strike and do not work on the grant during the strike, how should I complete the effort certification?\nIf the union calls a strike the university could stop pay unless an individual student elects to work.\u00a0Faculty PIs would not pay for work unless the student was confirmed to be working.\nIf a strike goes on longer than a month, for example, will faculty be allowed to reassign the research being done by the student to other people or is this considered retaliatory?\nManagers can reassign work during a strike, but there would likely be some obligation to shift work back to the striking employee once the strike is resolved.\nResearch Continuity During Unexpected Disruptions (/news/research-continuity-during-unexpected-disruptions)\nResearch & Innovation (/offices/ovpr)\nQuick Reference\nRates (/rates)\nForms (/forms)\nPolicies (/policies)\nContacts (/contacts)\nTraining (/training)\nEvents (/events)\nNews & Announcements (/news)\n\u00a9 2019 Cornell University\nWeb Accessibility Help (mailto:rais-help@cornell.edu?subject=researchservices.cornell.edu%20site)"

FollowingUniversity Policy 1.2 on Research Integrity, the university will vigorously investigate allegations of research misconduct and research-related misconduct that contravene these expectations, taking all reasonable steps to protect the rights and interests of individuals whose work or performance is questioned. (https://policy.cornell.edu/policy-library/research-integrity)\nDefinition of Research Misconduct and Research-Related Misconduct:\nResearch misconductis defined as fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results, according to the Code of Federal Regulations42 CFR Part 93: (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/chapter-I/subchapter-H/part-93?toc=1)\nFabrication is making up data or results and recording or reporting them.\nFalsification is manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes, or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record.\nPlagiarism is the appropriation of another person's ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit.\nResearch-related misconductis defined inUniversity Policy 1.2 on Research Integrity(Section 3, Definitions) and is summarized as follows: (https://policy.cornell.edu/policy-library/research-integrity)\nAny act that violates the standards of integrity in the conduct of scholarly and scientific research and communication outside the parameters of research misconduct as defined in this policy and relevant federal regulations. Examples of research-related misconduct can be found in Policy 1.2, Research Integrity, Section 3, Definitions). Research-related misconduct also includes any form of retaliation against a person who, while acting in good faith, provides information about suspected or alleged misconduct.\nResearch-related misconduct includes other unacceptable behaviors that Cornell has elected to prohibit that may appear in an academic environment. Cornell adheres to the procedures for investigating research misconduct allegations required by federal agencies as a condition of federal funding.\nWhat constitutes Research Misconduct or Research-Related Misconduct?\nA finding of research misconduct requires:\nA significant departure from accepted practices of the relevant research community;\nThat the conduct was intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly committed; and\nproven allegations by a preponderance of the evidence.\nMisconduct does not include an unintentional error or honest differences in interpretations or judgments of data.\nWhat must I do if I encounter Research Misconduct or Research-Related Misconduct?\nAll members of the Cornell community have a responsibility to report suspected research misconduct or research-related misconduct underUniversity Policy 1.2 on Research Integrity.

The following topics are covered as a part of Cornell\u2019s RCR educational offerings.\nAuthorship\n(Adapted fromThe HHS Office of Research Integrity: Authorship) (https://ori.hhs.gov/content/Chapter-9-Authorship-and-Publication-Authorship)\nThe names that appear at the beginning of a paper let others know who conducted and should be credited for the research. This is important in case there are questions about methods, data, and the interpretation of results. It is also important because researchers are often promoted in accordance with the quality and quantity of their publications.\u00a0The named authors and byline order should be discussed with all participants as early on as possible, in order to avoid disputes later on.For additional information please review\u00a0The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) recommendations onDefining the Role of Authors and Contributors. (https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html)\nCase Study\nCornell University: 2018 RCR Summer Workshop Case Studies (https://researchservices.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/2018%20RCR%20Symposium%20Case%20Studies.pdf)\nThe Office of Research Integrity (ORI) RCR Casebook: Risky Authorship (https://ori.hhs.gov/case-two-risky-authorship)\nThe Office of Research Integrity (ORI) RCR Casebook: Should I be Listed as an Author? (https://ori.hhs.gov/case-three-should-i-be-listed-author)\nCollaborative research\n(Adapted fromThe HHS Office of Research Integrity: A Brief Overview on Conflict of Interests) (https://ori.hhs.gov/content/Chapter-8-Collaborative-Research-Introduction)\nCollaborative research happens when researchers team up with colleagues who have the expertise or resources needed to carry out a particular project. Collaborations can be as simple as one researcher sharing techniques or materials with another researcher, or as complex as multi-centered projects that involve academic research centers, government laboratories, and for-profit companies working under a single project.\nCase Study\nThe Office of Research Integrity (ORI) RCR Casebook: Conflicts with Community Partners (https://ori.hhs.gov/case-two-conflicts-community-leaders)\nConflict of Interest\n(Adapted fromThe HHS Office of Research Integrity: ORI Introduction to RCR) (https://ori.hhs.gov/brief-overview-conflict-interests)\nA conflict of interest arises whenever a researcher\u2019s relationship with organization affects or gives the appearance of affecting, his or her ability to be objective in the conduct of their research. Some conflicts of interest are unavoidable, and having a conflict of interest is not in itself unethical. However, even the perception of a conflict can damage the public\u2019s trust in research. To mitigate these situations, guidelines for managing them are necessary.\nCase Study\nCornell University: 2021 RCR Symposium Case Studies (https://researchservices.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/2022-07/2021%20RCR%20Symposium%20Case%20Studies%20%5Bfinal%5D.pdf)\nData management\n(Adapted fromThe HHS Office of Research Integrity: Guidelines for Responsible Data Management in Scientific Research) (https://ori.hhs.gov/guidelines-responsible-data-management-scientific-research)\nData management is a critical component of most scientific research studies. Oversight of data management represents a significant investment of time and effort by the PI, and for oversight to be thorough and correct, PIs must understand the basic concepts of data management and ensure that every member of their research team is involved in the planning, implementation, and maintenance of data management policies and procedures.\nCase Study\nCornell University: 2019 RCR Case Studies (https://researchservices.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/2022-07/2019%20RCR%20Symposium%20Case%20Studies%20%5Bfinal%5D.pdf)\nThe Office of Research Integrity (ORI) RCR Casebook: Creating a Public Archive of Sensitive Data (https://ori.hhs.gov/case-one-creating-public-archive-sensitive-data)\nThe Office of Research Integrity (ORI) RCR Casebook: Data Sharing Fever (https://ori.hhs.gov/case-two-data-sharing-fever)\nMentoring\n(Adapted fromThe HHS Office of Research Integrity: Introduction to the Responsible Conduct of Research) (https://ori.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/rcrintro.pdf)\nMentor-trainee relationships begin when an experienced and an inexperienced researcher agree to work together. In any successful mentor-trainee relationship, each person brings something valuable to the table. The experienced researcher has knowledge and skills that the inexperienced researcher needs to learn and may also provide support for the trainee\u2019s research and education. Inexperienced researchers, whether graduate students, postdocs, or research staff, provide labor and fresh ideas. Under a productive relationship, the two work together to advance knowledge and put ideas to work.\nCase Study\nCornell University: 2023 RCR Symposium Case Studies (/sites/default/files/2023-05/2023%20RCR%20Symposium%20Case%20Studies.pdf)\nThe Office of Research Integrity (ORI) RCR Casebook: Power Struggles in the Lab (https://ori.hhs.gov/case-three-power-struggles-lab)\nThe Office of Research Integrity (ORI) RCR Casebook: Bullied or Mentored?

Peer reviews must be objective and should be based solely on scientific evaluation of the material under review and within the context of published information. These reviews should not be influenced by scientific information that is not publicly available.\nCase Study\nThe Office of Research Integrity (ORI) RCR Casebook: Pandering to the Public (https://ori.hhs.gov/case-one-pandering-public)\nThe Office of Research Integrity (ORI) RCR Casebook: Getting a Fair Shake?

When proposing to use animals in research there must be appropriate scientific support to justify the experiments. This analysis is conducted by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). At Cornell, the IACUC reviews all proposed projects involving animals to ensure that they meet scientific and humane standards, including those determined by the NIH.\nCase Study\nCornell University: Animal Welfare Case Studies (https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/bionb491/assignments/AnimalWelfare.pdf, https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/bionb491/assignments/AnimalWelfare.pdf)\nResearch with Human Participants\n(Adapted fromThe NIH: Guidelines for the Conduct of Research at the National Institutes of Health) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK236202/)\nResearch involving human participants entails a rigorous responsibility for the well-being of the research subjects. Human participants make an important contribution to science, and this commitment must invite in return the utmost respect and diligence from the researcher. Respect and diligence should include planning studies so that the potential benefits (to both the subject and society) outweigh any risks. In addition, steps must be taken to ensure that subjects are selected equitably and that they make an informed decision when consenting to participate in the study. Informed consent requires that patients be fully informed of the risks and benefits of the research, be competent to evaluate this information, and make a decision free from coercion and other inappropriate influences.\nCase Study\nThe Office of Research Integrity (ORI) RCR Casebook: I Really Can\u2019t Acquire Important Data?

Therefore, all Cornell units that charge individual salaries to accounts that include sponsored, including program income and cost-shared sources, and federal appropriations activity (i.e., Federal Capacity Funds) must submit\u00a0signed \"Salary Certification\" worksheets to Sponsored Financial Services (SFS) each fiscal year. (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/subtitle-A/chapter-II/part-200, /resources/uniform-guidance-federal-awards)\nThose required to complete the Salary Certification worksheets should first reviewUniversity Policy 3.11, Salary Confirmation. The policy addresses the requirements for salary certification and provides information on how to make changes to the university records, when necessary. (https://policy.cornell.edu/policy-library/salary-confirmation)\nFor further instructions, please refer to the training materials:\nFY 2024 Salary Certification Training Presentation (PDF) (https://finance.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/fy24-salary-certification-training.pdf)\nEffort Reporting Training for Principal Investigators\nThe Vice President\u00a0for Research and Innovation announced in 2012 that \"the university must require all our principal investigators (PIs) to complete a brief training regarding the regulations and policies governing personnel effort on sponsored awards and the related verification of salaries, also known as effort certification.\" The training\u00a0and changes to theSalary Confirmationpolicy\u00a0were implemented in response to a federal audit citing Cornell in this area. Below are instructions for completing the training through CULearn. You must complete the tutorial\u00a0through the last slide and answer review questions before your completed course can be recorded. (https://www.dfa.cornell.edu/policy/policies/salary-confirmation)\nTo take the tutorial:\nGo to theDFS\u00a0Yearly Effort Certification for Project Directors Tutorialcourse page in CULearn (Cornell NetID and password required).

(https://www.bestbuy.com/site/tech-tips/disable-popup-blocker/pcmcat748301880694.c?id=pcmcat748301880694)\nHighlights of the Salary Certification Process\nThe certification process for both the endowed division and contract colleges is required only for individuals with salary charges to sponsored accounts, federal appropriated accounts, or cost-sharing accounts. All other personnel are excluded from this process.\nThe report contains year-to-date (YTD) actual salaries. Reports will be generated by employee ID and position.\nSummer salary will appear on a separate report.\nFaculty or staff members can sign their individual reports, or units may use a group certification form. If using the group certification form, units must obtain suitable verification that the work was actually performed and is allocable to the sponsored award. Units must have written documentation that this verification was performed.\nReports will be distributed via Secure File Transfer or CALS Salary Certification System.See theCALS Salary Confirmation System Yammer groupfor information on the CALS system for managing the SFS\u00a0Salary Certification process. (https://www.yammer.com/cornell.edu/#/threads/inGroup?type=in_group&feedId=8422794&view=all)\nSee theCALS Salary Confirmation System Yammer groupfor information on the CALS system for managing the SFS\u00a0Salary Certification process. (https://www.yammer.com/cornell.edu/#/threads/inGroup?type=in_group&feedId=8422794&view=all)\nThe certification process will incorporate all 12 months of the fiscal year. Data will includeFY 2024\u00a0salary transfersthat have been submitted and approvedby July 15, 2024.\nAfter July 15, additional changes or corrections to FY 2024\u00a0earnings must be made using the Salary Expense Transfer (ST) e-doc. The percentages and dollar amounts must be manually updated on the salary certification report, and the ST e-doc number must be noted. Prospective changes can be done in Workday.\nAll final certified reports must be remitted to Sponsored Financial Services byFriday, September 13, 2024,using one of the following options:Complete the Group Certification Form, including the suitable means of verification\u00a0and insert it as the cover page of a PDF file that includes each Salary Certification report produced for the respective org; certify the cover page with an authenticated digital signature and upload the completed PDF file viaCornell Secure File Transferto\u00a0Hui (Joyce) Wang (hw582).If the unit prefers to submit individually certified Salary Certification reports, ensure that each report has been certified with an authenticated digital signature and upload all certified Salary Certification reports produced for the respective org in one submission viaCornell Secure File Transferto Hui (Joyce) Wang (hw582).If the unit prefers to provide physical paper reports that are either group certified or individually certified, ink-signed certifications are still accepted; please make arrangements withHui (Joyce) Wangto coordinate delivery by the due date.

(mailto:hw582@cornell.edu)\nNote:Salaries that have been certified through the salary certification process should only be transferred from a sponsored account for clearing an overdraft or removing an inappropriate charge. The salary must be transferred to an appropriate non-sponsored account or in the event of a true overdraft, to a cost share sub-account. In all cases, a complete explanation for the transfer must be reflected on the ST e-doc. A recertified salary certification report for the period affected, noting the ST e-doc number, must be sent to Sponsored Financial Services.\nWe are continually seeking ways to enhance our processes to minimize the administrative requirements for academic units while fulfilling our obligation to meet federal, state, and other requirements. In this spirit, your feedback concerning the salary certification process, as well as any recommendations for future enhancements, are encouraged.

(mailto:cu_subawards@cornell.edu)\nHow do I know if I need a subaward?\nIf an award is issued to Cornell and a portion of the programmatic work will be performed by another institution/entity, a subaward may need to be issued. A subaward request is submitted by the unit research administrator in Cornell\u2019sResearch Administration Support System (RASS)and the Subaward Team will complete the subaward process. Subawards can only be signed by the Office of Sponsored Programs. (https://rass.cornell.edu/login)\nWhen should I determine if there will be a subaward?\nThe determination of a potential collaboration is normally made at proposal submission stage. For assistance with determining if the collaboration is a subaward or contractor, please complete theSubaward vs Contractor checklist. (/sites/default/files/2022-11/Subrecipient%20vs%20Contractor%20Checklist.pdf)\nWhat is the difference between a vendor/procurement agreement and a subaward?Contracted services require a procurement agreement negotiated by Cornell\u2019s Procurement and Payment Services,procurement@cornell.edu. It conforms with the university\u2019s and in some cases the sponsor\u2019s procurement requirements. Substantive programmatic work of a sponsored project requires a subaward, which is negotiated by Cornell\u2019s Office of Sponsored Programs. The subaward contains (or flows down) most of the terms and conditions of the parent award. (mailto:procurement@cornell.edu)\nWhat if I determine I need a subaward after the grant has been awarded?\nIf you become aware of the need for collaboration after your award has been made to Cornell, you will likely need to request prior approval for subawarding, and possibly rebudgeting, from the sponsoring agency. Your unit research administrator will need to gather the appropriate documents from the potential subrecipient and submit a request on the prime award record in RASS. The prime award Grant and Contract Officer (GCO) will then request prior approval from the sponsor.\nWhat information do I need to provide for the subaward?\nThe sponsor needs to approve the scope of work and the budget of the collaborator. Depending on the sponsor and the project, additional information may be necessary such as a biographical sketch, current and pending, collaborators and other affiliations, etc. Please work with the prime award GCO to assist with the additional documentation required by the prime sponsor.\nI received an award, will my subaward be set up automatically?No, subawards are not set up automatically when a prime award is granted to Cornell. The unit research administrator must initiate the new subaward request on the subaward record in RASS. For guidance on initiating a subaward in RASS, please see:https://guide.rass.cornell.edu/sponsored-projects/initiate-a-subaward. (https://guide.rass.cornell.edu/sponsored-projects/initiate-a-subaward)\nHow is a subaward set up?\nThe unit research administrator will initiate the new subaward request on the subaward record in RASS. The Subaward Team will review the request and complete the subaward process. Once the subaward is fully executed by both the subaward institution/entity and Cornell the Subaward Team will distribute the new subaward in RASS. Sponsored Financial Services will establish a subaccount (except when a unit requires a related account) for the subaward and move a portion of the budget therein.\nMy grant has been extended and/or provided additional funds for another year. Will my collaborator's subaward automatically be extended?\nNo, subawards are not automatically extended. The unit research administrator will need to submit an amendment/modification request on each subaward record in RASS. For guidance on submitting a change request seehttps://guide.rass.cornell.edu/sponsored-projects/submit-change-requests/ (https://guide.rass.cornell.edu/sponsored-projects/submit-change-requests/)\nCan subrecipients receive Indirect Costs (IDC)?Indirect Cost terms flow down from the prime award. If the prime grant allows IDC at an entity\u2019s/institution\u2019s federally negotiated rate, then the subrecipient is allowed to collect at their federally negotiated IDC rate. A copy of the subrecipient\u2019s federally negotiated IDC rate agreement, or a link to it online, is required. If the subrecipient does not have a federally negotiated indirect cost rate agreement, they are eligible to elect a rate up to the federal de minimis IDC rate which is calculated on Modified Total Direct Costs (not Total Direct Costs). If the prime award and/or prime sponsor restricts IDC on either the prime award, the RFP, their grant terms and conditions, this same restriction flows down to the subrecipient entity/institution. As defined by the Uniform Guidance, \u201cModified Total Direct Cost (MTDC) means all direct salaries and wages, applicable fringe benefits, materials and supplies, services, travel, and up to the first $25,000 of eachsubaward(regardless of theperiod of performanceof thesubawardsunder the award).MTDCexcludes equipment,capital expenditures, charges for patient care, rental costs, tuition remission, scholarships and fellowships,participant support costsand the portion of eachsubawardin excess of $25,000..\u201d (https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/index.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=cd3b6bbdd85489e2f50207d7536faf9a&term_occur=999&term_src=Title:2:Subtitle:A:Chapter:II:Part:200:Subpart:A:Subjgrp:27:200.1, https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/index.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=b9eea7ef3254392f126610da821da9fc&term_occur=999&term_src=Title:2:Subtitle:A:Chapter:II:Part:200:Subpart:A:Subjgrp:27:200.1, https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/index.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=cd3b6bbdd85489e2f50207d7536faf9a&term_occur=999&term_src=Title:2:Subtitle:A:Chapter:II:Part:200:Subpart:A:Subjgrp:27:200.1, https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/index.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=3fc08bf43de695af703c88a684c5a16b&term_occur=999&term_src=Title:2:Subtitle:A:Chapter:II:Part:200:Subpart:A:Subjgrp:27:200.1, https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/index.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=206c8d2689878e2925e319171ace2528&term_occur=999&term_src=Title:2:Subtitle:A:Chapter:II:Part:200:Subpart:A:Subjgrp:27:200.1, https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/index.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=4a831c0e0aebf1a64324677f8556a34b&term_occur=999&term_src=Title:2:Subtitle:A:Chapter:II:Part:200:Subpart:A:Subjgrp:27:200.1, https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/index.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=cd3b6bbdd85489e2f50207d7536faf9a&term_occur=999&term_src=Title:2:Subtitle:A:Chapter:II:Part:200:Subpart:A:Subjgrp:27:200.1)\nHow is IDC (Indirect Costs) calculated on subaward expenses on my grant?\nCornell\u2019s federally negotiated rate agreement allows us to collect IDC up to the first $25,000 of each subaward. Prime awards may have other allowable rates that affect the amount of IDC that Cornell can collect on subawards. This information is usually clearly stated in the solicitation and prime award terms and conditions that Cornell receives.\nAre subawards paid in full when the award is signed?\nNo, subawards are generally not paid in advance. Nearly all subawards are cost reimbursable with very few exceptions. The subrecipient must incur allowable expenses and submit invoices to the Cornell Financial/Invoicing Contact identified in their subaward agreement. The Cornell Unit and PI are responsible for monitoring the technical performance of the subrecipient and approval of all subaward expenses/invoices submitted for payment. For additional information see theSubawards: Roles and Responsibilities page. (/resources/subawards-roles-and-responsibilities)\nI am working with a subaward on my project, what are my responsibilities?\nThe Cornell PI is responsible for monitoring a subrecipient\u2019s progress toward completion of the work they agreed to perform. The unit research administrator should review all subrecipient invoices for elements that include proper form, conformance with the agreement and budget, expected expenditures to date, including any required cost-sharing. The PI should review all subrecipient invoices to ensure that the invoices reflect the progress made on the subaward work. The unit research administrator and PI are also responsible for ensuring the subrecipient submits all invoices, deliverables and technical reports as required under the subaward agreement. For additional information see theSubawards: Roles and Responsibilities page. (/resources/subawards-roles-and-responsibilities)\nWhat information is required on a subrecipient invoice?\nInvoices can be submitted using the subrecipient\u2019s standard invoice, but at a minimum must include current and cumulative costs (including cost sharing), billing period, and the subaward ID. They should also include a signed certification by the subrecipient as to truth and accuracy of invoice. Subaward invoices on federal funds must also include the following:\n\u201cBy signing this report, I certify to the best of my knowledge and belief that the report is true, complete, and accurate, and the expenditures, disbursements and cash receipts are for the purposes and objectives set forth in the terms and conditions of the Federal award. I am aware that any false, fictitious, or fraudulent information, or the omission of any material fact, may subject me to criminal, civil or administrative penalties for fraud, false statements, false claims or otherwise. (U.S. Code Title 18, Section 1001 and Title 31, Sections 3729-3730 and 3801-3812).\u201d Sample invoice templates are available forcost-reimbursableandfixed-price subawards.

Can anyone help me?\nIf your subrecipient is not performing adequately, including submitting invoices as outlined in the subaward agreement, promptly contact the Subaward Team atcu_subawards@cornell.eduand provide us with the details and a copy of any correspondence you have sent. The Subaward Team will work with you to determine the most appropriate course of action. If the subrecipient is not performing and there is a questionable invoice you should consult the Subaward Teampriorto paying. (mailto:cu_subawards@cornell.edu)\nI\u2019ve decided I want to spend my grant funds differently and want to eliminate or modify my subaward budget. Can I do this?\nDiscuss this question with your prime award GCO. You will need to modify the budget on your prime grant by working with your unit research administrator. The change may require prime sponsor prior approval if the change includes a change of scope, a change in key personnel named in the award, rebudgeting participant support to any other category of expense, etc. A subaward that has already been issued will need to be modified. The unit research administrator will need to submit an amendment/modification request once prior approval has been received or it is determined that prior approval for the change is not required. Since a subaward is a legally binding agreement, this process will take time and there may be agreement provisions that require adequate notice prior to modification. Clear communication between the Cornell PI and the Collaborator is essential.\nManaging Subawards (/process/managing-subawards)\nSubawards: Roles and Responsibilities (/resources/subawards-roles-and-responsibilities)\nSubcontractor Commitment Form (/forms/subcontractor-commitment-form)\nIssuing the Subaward Agreement (/resources/issuing-subaward-agreement)\nFederal Demonstration Partnership (FDP) Expanded Clearinghouse Program (/resources/federal-demonstration-partnership-fdp-expanded-clearinghouse-program)\nSubawards: Risk Assessment (/resources/subawards-risk-assessment)\nPayments to Subrecipients on Sponsored Projects (/resources/payments-subrecipients-sponsored-projects)\nAmendment to Subaward Agreements (/resources/amendment-subaward-agreements)\nSubrecipient Monitoring: Financial and Technical (/resources/subrecipient-monitoring-financial-and-technical)\nQuick Reference\nRates (/rates)\nForms (/forms)\nPolicies (/policies)\nContacts (/contacts)\nTraining (/training)\nEvents (/events)\nNews & Announcements (/news)\n\u00a9 2019 Cornell University\nWeb Accessibility Help (mailto:rais-help@cornell.edu?subject=researchservices.cornell.edu%20site)"

Additional modifications are made to the subaward based on arisk assessment of the subrecipientwhich includes but is not limited to a review of: (http://thefdp.org/default/assets/File/Documents/risk_assessment_questionaire.xlsx)\nSubrecipient financial status and internal controls\nAmount of subaward\nPercentage of award passed through to subrecipient\nProgram complexity\nIn some instances, a subrecipient may be designated as elevated risk. This means that based on an evaluation of many factors including the award, supporting financial documents, the institutional profile completed by the subrecipient, and prior history of working with the entity that there is an above-average likelihood of programmatic or financial concerns during the subaward period. Examples include:\nA small organization receives a very large subaward and may not have the business systems in place to account for the award in the manner prescribed by the prime sponsor.\nA university has a history of multiple audit findings.\nA company has a track record of failing to deliver on Cornell projects.\nA non-governmental organization is operating in a remote area of the world where communication and monitoring is difficult.\nOnce the subaward draft is complete, the Subaward Officer sends it unsigned to the subrecipient for review.The subrecipient may want to negotiate changes or request clarification of the terms and conditions. The Subaward Officer negotiates the changes, coordinating requested changes with unit administrators and the PI, where appropriate.Once negotiations are complete and the signed subaward is received, the Subaward Officer executes it on behalf of Cornell, returns the fully executed document to the subrecipient, and distributes the fully executed award to the PI, unit administrator, and Sponsored Financial Services. If a subrecipient is deemed to pose \"elevated risk,\"the PI will be responsible for specific monitoring and approvals.

Previously there was no standard for payment. Please make sure that invoices are reviewed and disbursement voucher (DV) e-docs are prepared and approved so that the check/ACH is issued within 30 days of invoice receipt. It is important to retain documentation of any invoice problems or deliverables to substantiate a delayed payment, and this should be noted in the DV. Please work with the Office of Sponsored Programs or Sponsored Financial Services, as appropriate, where problems exist with sub-awardees.

In practical terms, this limits the applicability of this option to the 60 days following most awards (30 days for most sub-awards).

Planning and collaboration between incoming/outgoing researchers and research administrators can help make the transition smoother for all.\nNCURA magazine article covers the questions on this page in more detail.NCURA Magazine Article: Award Transfers: Anticipate Issues to Forestall Them (Oct/Nov 2018)Authored by Cornell OSP Grant & Contract Officers Bella DiFranzo and Jamie Sprague. (https://www.osp.cornell.edu/Education/protected/NCURA/NCURA_Magazine-Article_AwardTransfers_OctNov2018.pdf)\nCan and Should an Award Transfer?\nBefore initiating an award transfer, considerations should include:\nTerms and conditions. Will the\u00a0terms and conditions allow an award to be transferred?\nAgreement from original institution.Awards are issued to institutions, not PIs directly. In some cases, the original institution may not agree to the transfer.\nOther project personnel.Project personnel may or may not transfer to the new institution with the PI. In those instances, care should be taken to ensure plans are made for continued support for research staff and especially for students supported by the award.\nTime remaining.Transferring an award can be complex, and sometimes time consuming. In some cases, it may be\u00a0best to retain the award at the original institution.\nOther options.Consider other options, including retaining the award at the original institution and assigning a new PI, issuing a subaward to the new institution, or giving the PI a temporary appointment at the original institution.\nCommon Issues\nEach award and relationship is unique, but this list includes some of the issues encountered when transferring an award.Note:See the linked article for more detail about each.

Travel expenses and requests should be clearly justified and reasonable. The budget should be based on historical data,Cornell's Travel Policy, airline quotes from a travel agency, and sponsor guidelines. (https://www.dfa.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/vol3_2.pdf)\nTravel costs are classified as those expenses for transportation, lodging, subsistence and related items incurred by employees who are traveling on official University business.\nUnless otherwise stated by the sponsor, domestic travel is considered to be travel among any of the 50 United States, its possessions and territories, and Canada.\nForeign travel is classified as travel outside these areas.\nTravel in excess of commercial coach airfare is normally nonrecoverable.Foreign travel is a restricted category by most federal agencies and requires prior approval by the sponsor.

FERPA compliance is primarily managed by the University Registrar, but the IRB and FERPA overlap when identifiable student records (e.g., class assignments, exams, course rosters, etc.) are used for research purposes. (https://registrar.cornell.edu/service-resources/ferpa)\nBelow are some examples of common scenarios where IRB and FERPA might intersect, as well as additional Cornell FERPA and student data resources. As always, please reach out to the IRB staff (irbhp@cornell.edu) if you have any questions about your human participant research. You can also learn more about the use of student data on theRegistrar\u2019s website, or contact their office atunivreg@cornell.edu. (mailto:irbhp@cornell.edu, https://registrar.cornell.edu/service-resources/use-student-data, mailto:univreg@cornell.edu)\nNote: where written consent is mentioned below, this pertains to the FERPA requirement of written consent from a student giving permission for use of their FERPA-protected records.This is different thanIRB requirements for written consent.Learn more about the FERPA written consent requirement on the Cornell University Registrar'sFERPA FAQs site. (https://researchservices.cornell.edu/resources/irb-informed-consent, https://registrar.cornell.edu/FERPA_FAQ)\n\nStudent Data Use Scenarios:\n1. Use of identifiable student grades or test/quiz scores for research purposesFERPA protected. Written consent is required.\n2. Use of identifiable student writing (e.g., Canvas posts, class writing exercises, correspondence about a course) for research purposesFERPA protected. Written consent is required.\n3.Use of de-identified student grades or other student records for research purposes, if obtained from someone who has legitimate access to those dataNot FERPA protected; no FERPA concerns regarding use of data.IRB Note: Depending on the details and context, this project may still constitute human participant research, and require IRB approval or exemption.\n4. Students in a specific class are required to participate in an activity (e.g., complete a survey, participate in a focus group, etc.) as part of the class requirements, and the outcomes/responses will also be used for research purposesFERPA protected. Written consent is required in order to use the activity outcomes/responses for research purposes.\n5.Students in a specific class are invited to participate in optional activities only meant for research purposes (e.g., a survey, a focus group), not to be used for class assignments/gradesNot FERPA protected.IRB Note: IRB review is still needed for this research.\n6.Observation of students\u2019 behavior in the classroom for research purposesa.The researcher is only watching students and taking notes.Not FERPA protected, but caution regarding capturing identifiable student characteristics.\nb.The researcher wants to record (video or audio) or photograph the studentsFERPA protected. Written consent is required.\n7.Use of identifiable student records for research purposes after the student has graduatedFERPA protected. Written consent is required.\n8.Student course evaluations that will only be used to improve instruction, with no intention to generalize or publish findingsExempt from FERPA: While considered an educational record, the use of teaching evaluations to improve pedagogy is considered a legitimate educational interest by a University official and is a supported activity under FERPA. Therefore, no\u00a0additional written consent is required. Caution should be used if results could eventually be broadened to additional external research opportunities.IRB Note: this activity is not considered \u201cresearch\u201d, so no IRB review would be needed.\n9.Student evaluations of instructorsNot FERPA protected.\n10.Use of a class roster to contact and invite students from a specific class to participate in a research projectFERPA protected. In order to avoid the written consent requirement, this could be handled by having the research recruitment email/invitation sent by the class instructor (who has a legitimate educational interest in accessing that FERPA protected information).\n\nCornell FERPA/Student Data Resources\nLearn more about FERPA and how you can access and use student data for research:\nFERPA FAQs (https://registrar.cornell.edu/FERPA_FAQ)\nUse of student data (information and access) (https://registrar.cornell.edu/service-resources/use-student-data)\nAnnual Privacy Notification under FERPA (found on theCornell Courses of Study webpage, and highlights information fromCornell Policy 4.5 Access to Student Information) (https://courses.cornell.edu/, https://www.dfa.cornell.edu/tools-library/policies/access-student-information)\nUniversity Registrar officecontact:univreg@cornell.edu, (607) 255-4232 (https://registrar.cornell.edu/service-resources/university-registrar-directory, mailto:univreg@cornell.edu)\nResearch with Human Participants (/compliance/human-research)\nInstitutional Review Board for Human Participant Research (IRB) Office (/offices/IRB)\nIRB Informed Consent (/resources/irb-informed-consent)\nQuick Reference\nRates (/rates)\nForms (/forms)\nPolicies (/policies)\nContacts (/contacts)\nTraining (/training)\nEvents (/events)\nNews & Announcements (/news)\n\u00a9 2019 Cornell University\nWeb Accessibility Help (mailto:rais-help@cornell.edu?subject=researchservices.cornell.edu%20site)"

Check out ourNSF CAREER Tool Kitfor helpful information and resources. (https://researchservices.cornell.edu/resources/nsf-career-proposal-tool-kit)\nNSF Center Grants\nNSF supports a variety of center programs that contribute to the Foundation's mission and vision. Centers exploit opportunities in science, engineering, and technology in which the complexity of the research program or the resources needed to solve the problem require the advantages of scope, scale, duration, equipment, facilities, and students. Centers are a principle means by which NSF fosters interdisciplinary research.\nScience and Technology Centers (STCs)\nThe STC: Integrative Partnerships program supports exceptionally innovative, complex research and education projects that require large-scale, long-term awards.\nSTCs focus on creating new scientific paradigms, establishing entirely new scientific disciplines and developing transformative technologies which have the potential for broad scientific or societal impact.\nSTCs conduct world-class research through partnerships among institutions of higher education, national laboratories, industrial organizations, other public or private entities, and via international collaborations, as appropriate.\nSTCs may involve any area of science and engineering that NSF supports.\nVisit theSTC program webpagefor further details and current funding opportunities. (https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5541)\nEngineering Research Centers (ERCs)\nThe ERC program supports convergent research, education, and technology translation at U.S. universities that will lead to strong societal impacts.\nEach ERC has interacting foundational components that go beyond the research project, including engineering workforce development at all participant stages, a culture of diversity and inclusion where all participants gain mutual benefit, and value creation within an innovation ecosystem that will outlast the lifetime of the ERC.\nCurrent funding opportunities and more may be found on theERC program webpage.

To keep Cornell\u2019s research activities in compliance with requirements from the federal government, Research & Innovation partnered with eCornell to develop a new course covering both the responsible conduct of research and research security. This short, new course is customized to our community and provides an efficient way to fulfill those government training requirements, delivered to you by our own campus experts.\nThe new course:\nMeets the current federal requirements for research security training.\nMeets Responsible Conduct of Research Training requirements as set forth by federal agencies.\nReplaces previous courses in Responsible Conduct of Research. (If you work with animal or human subjects, additional training requirements still apply.)\nThe course,CU601 - Responsible Conduct of Research and Research Security, will be assigned to anyone who is named on or paid on a research project at Cornell. You\u2019ll receive a notification from CULearn that it has been assigned to you.Note: the course takes about 30 minutes to complete. Please take it using a laptop or desktop computer. It is not designed for use on mobile devices. Be sure to complete the 1-question quiz at the end and clickSubmit Quizso that your completion is registered.
